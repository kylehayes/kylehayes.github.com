<div class="entry-content"><p>I started a project a couple of months ago that has and is going to
continually have a very complex and growing architecture. The technology stack
in place is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/flex">Flex 3</a>, <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Cairngorm">Cairngorm 2.2</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/coldfusion">ColdFusion 8</a>,
<a href="http://coldspringframework.org/">ColdSpring</a>, <a href="http://www.transfer-orm.com/">Transfer</a>, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.mspx">SQL Server 2005</a>. This is my first
Flex application that will be using Transfer to handle the database
abstraction layer. Normally, I would use Brian Rinadi&#8217;s Illudium PU-36
CFCGenerator to handle the initial generation of all my CFCs and from there
would either modify the XSLT files or simply append to the generated CFCs as I
saw fit.</p>

<p>The problem with this type of approach lies namely in the early stages of
application design and development (especially since I traditionally don&#8217;t go
through a line of specs working on a solo project) when the database is going
through many changes. Each time you make a change to the database, you either
have to regenerate your files which will overwrite any changes you made, or
you have to manually hand-code the database changes. On top of this, it
doesn&#8217;t take care of any of your table relationships as per a 3rd normal form
database structure. You then have to design your own home-brew setup of such a
system if you require it, or simply provide functions that return the
structs/VOs to Flex as you need them by manually building up the hierarchical
tree of the model.</p>

<p>For this project, I knew from the beginning that the database schema was going
to be pretty complex and that it was also going to be going through changes as
I developed and tried things out. I knew that I wanted to get Transfer to work
with Flex. I had tried this once in the past and failed because I was
designing Flex applications differently at that time. I now know better to
design with a service layer in mind.</p>

<p>Although, it is not that easy either. There are actually quite a few steps
involved when using Transfer to interact with your database and to return the
right kind of objects back to Flex. Also, let me state, that I am talking
about this in terms of using the AMF protocol with RemoteObjects between
ColdFusion and Flex so that datatypes are appropriately and quickly
translated.</p>

<p>This post will first introduce the Transfer ORM framework and why it is not a
basic task to integrate it into your ColdFusion / Flex application. In the
next part of this article, I will discuss the technical details of getting
this all to work.</p>

<h3>Transfer ORM framework</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.transfer-orm.com/">Visit project website</a></p>

<p>ORM, or Object-Relational Mapping, in simplistic terms is abstracting a
representation of your data inside a database as objects in your application.
An ORM framework does all of this abstraction semi-automatically by means of
introspection to your database and generating the necessary files, or by a
configuration file that describes the datatypes and the relationships of the
tables to each other. Transfer falls into the latter category.</p>

<p>While some say that a fault of Transfer (esp when compared to a competing
framework, <a href="http://trac.reactorframework.com/">Reactor</a>) is that you have to write the table structure and
it&#8217;s relationships manually in an XML file. Whereas Reactor is a framework
that reads the database metadata. At first, I thought this same thing and
after working with Transfer later, have found it much better to be in control
and to define the relationships myself. With this method I really feel like I
have a much better understanding of what Transfer is creating when it
generates it&#8217;s objects. Plus when debugging your code it is easier to see what
columns/fields are causing issues in your relationships.</p>

<p>The benefits of using Transfer over generating the CFCs yourself using tools
like <a href="http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/">Brian Rinaldi&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cfcgenerator/">Illudium PU-36 CFCGenerator</a> is that once you
have defined your XML file, the actual creation of the CFCs is completely
automatic. To give you an example, let&#8217;s say you have a table in your database
called Employee that has the following fields: employeeId, firstName,
lastName, email. Once you have instantiated the TransferFactory, you simply
call the object the you would any other VO, only you haven&#8217;t previously
written it:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>Transfer.get() retrieves a specific Transfer object (which is defined in your
Transfer XML) with a Primary Key ID of &#8220;1&#8221;. Then it simply calls the generated
&#8220;getFirstName()&#8221; method on that object and returns it to you. That&#8217;s it! It is
really simple.</p>

<p>This is hardly even skimming the surface of what Transfer does for you. Let&#8217;s
say that an employee can have multiple phone numbers on file that you store in
a separate table called EmployeePhone. This is of course a One-to-Many
relationship. Once you have simply defined this relationship in your Transfer
XML you would then access the phone numbers this way:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>From there you can simply loop through that array which in turn provides
different EmployeePhone Transfer objects. You can configure in your XML
whether that relationship will return an array or query. Notice that I
mentioned it would return an array of <strong><em>Transfer Objects</em></strong>. This is where it
gets tricky. The default return type of any relational object is typed as a
Transfer Object. This is instantiated from the generic Transfer Object
interface in the framework and is what all the relational object inherit from.
However, you can change this by applying a decorator to any of your objects
which will change the type of the object to the decorator path. The decorator
will also allow you to add methods as well as change existing ones that the
Transfer Object defines.</p>

<p>As you can see, Transfer can be very very powerful in your applications. It
doesn&#8217;t require very much setup time and configuration. As with most advanced
concepts like this, it takes practice to really understand the underlying
methodologies and to use them wisely in your application. Also, do not think
that Transfer is simply a glorified code generator. Mark Mandel has spent a
lot of time utilizing ColdFusion&#8217;s unique strengths to truly make this a fast
and effecient framework to keep your application at top speed.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it for now. Next time I will actually get more technical about the
configuration file and start discussing how to prepare your CFC middle-tier
for Flex consumption.</p>
