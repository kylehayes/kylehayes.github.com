  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dominos.com now the stick to which all future online pizza ordering systems
(and other ordering systems) will be measured. The wife and I received a
coupon for Domino&#8217;s Pizza today in the mail, and while I normally don&#8217;t go for
eating out on a Monday night, she has been busy as of late and I had just
gotten home after sitting for quite some time in traffic. I was just going to
call in the order but then I decided to order online.</p>

<p>First of all, I immediately realized when I approached their page that they
have the &#8220;You got 30 minutes&#8221; marketing campaign right now. Also, I must say
that they have the nicest online pizza ordering site in the industry (though I
can only compare it to Papa John&#8217;s and Pizza Hut). There Web 2.0 look and feel
as well as Flash-y elements created great appeal and very nice appearance. But
that wasn&#8217;t the half of it&#8230;</p>

<p>Along with their launch of this new campaign came the launch of the &#8220;Pizza
Tracker&#8221;. This thing is awesome! A real-time application written in Flash
provide a slick interface and virtual viewport of your pizza each step of the
way. A large progress bar shows you the status from Order Placed, Prep, Bake,
Box, to Delivery all as it happens. In some of the steps, it even tells you
who completed that part of the process. It includes a glowing red filler for
each of the progress as the bar fills up. This application is a great example
of what non-technical companies can do to utilize today&#8217;s instant
gratification technologies like Flash and Data Services.</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots of the process as it was happening:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is now over 24 hours since I have purchased my Time Capsule, and now that I
have all three of my Macs backing up to it, I am much more of a happy camper.
Each computer is doing their appropriate backups at the time they are supposed
to on cue.</p>

<p>What I wanted to focus on here is the usability of a Time Capsule with
Windows. In a word, simple. The drive is easily available under it&#8217;s
appropriate share name and the same for the share folder under that drive. You
see all the files that Time Machine is using to backup the files and what not.
From the root level, you can create a new folder or multiple folders in case
you wanted to start backing stuff up from your Windows box as well.</p>

<p>One word of warning though, <em>DO NOT</em> open any of the Time Machine backup
folders in Windows [side note, they appear as folders in Windows, but on the
Mac they are actually the drive image system that Time Machine cleverly uses
to store stuff], it will cause issues. For some reason, they are very picky
and do not like to be touched. If you do, you may suffer the consequences and
receive an error like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://skitch.com/kylehayes/8b5i/system-preferences"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080302-m7t69dx72j9tjbqm5e6c4w9ni2.preview.jpg" alt="System Preferences" /></a></p>

<p>Uploaded with <a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://skitch.com">Skitch</a>!</p>

<p>This high level error doesn&#8217;t tell you much about why it cannot mount the
volume. When I first came across this, I tried numerous things like rebooting
my computer and the like. I tried deleting the backup that was there for my
system and it wouldn&#8217;t let me because the &#8220;banks&#8221; folder was in use. Turns
out, this was one of the folders that I had opened on my Windows box.</p>

<p>I went over to my Windows machine, and didn&#8217;t notice any applications or
Explorer using the folder, so I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do. Then I rebooted the
Time Capsule hoping it would remove anything that was &#8220;connected&#8221; to it and I
was then able to delete the backup and re-start my desktop process.</p>

<p>If you read anything in this post read this: DO NOT TOUCH YOUR BACKUP FOLDERS
FROM TIME MACHINE WITHIN WINDOWS!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot has happened since I posted my first entry of opening my Time Capsule. I
would like to report on what all has gone with it since then. After I got
everything setup with the network, I wanted to start using Time Machine with
it. My first thought was wondering if I could transfer my pre-existing Time
Machine data that I have been backing up since Leopard came out, onto the new
drive. After a quick Google search, I did not really find anything useful.</p>

<p>In the Time Machine preferences, I went ahead and clicked &#8220;Change Disk&#8230;&#8221; to
change it to use Time Capsule from this point forth. What this does, is it
makes does that all too painful initial data dump of everything. I forgot what
a chore this is time-wise. Luckily, you can do other things while it quietly
chugs away at passing my precious data across the network. Something to note
about this initial dump&#8230;DO NOT INTERRUPT IT! I found this out by accident. I
was changing a few network settings in the Time Capsule airport stuff, and
clicked &#8220;Apply&#8221;&#8211;all of the sudden I received a message saying that a network
drive had been unplugged. Yep, the router started as well as the entire Time
Capsule. Therefore, the initial dump stopped.</p>

<p>I thought, not a big deal, I will just restart it once it is back up. So I
did. And it seemed to connect until about 20 minutes later, I checked the
progress and it was only 25KB along!!! What?!!?! I had seen this problem once
before when attempting to backup my MacBook over the network when I first
tried out Time Machine. With that, I recalled that if I dumped the initial
drive image that had been created on the Time Machine drive, and started it
back up, it would start again without a hitch. I did this, and sure enough it
began backing up again. However, this time did not go as smoothly either as I
did not learn from my last lesson and accidentally restarted my router again!
This time during my G5 desktop backup and my MacBook.</p>

<p>I started from scratch on the drive and this time just started my MacBook. I
will let my G5 start when it is ready at 11:30pm tonight.</p>

<h3>Airport</h3>

<p>As for the Airport part of the Time Capsule, I like it much better than my
previous Buffalo Turbo G AirStation router (namely due to the native OS X
interface known as the Airport Utility). I am familiar with this utility as I
have owned an Airport Express for many years as a wireless audio distributor.
But now that I have replaced my network with a real Airport Extreme (which I
have wanted for a while now) I get to reap the benefits of what I hope to be a
great router. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the Buffalo is great and I highly recommend
that brand to anyone in the market. I have tried every consumer brand out
there and nothing worked as great, and had as many useful features, with a
great web interface, as this Buffalo router.</p>

<p>Anyway, it has a very easy to use interface as you can see from some of the
images below:</p>

<p>It supports a lot of the standard stuff like port mapping. But because it is
the Airport Extreme, you can also hook up a printer to make it a network
printer, or another drive (USB) to add more storage that is network
accessible. However, what you cannot do is add a second drive and add to your
existing TIme Machine storage. You can only select one drive that Time Machine
will work with.</p>

<p>Other than that, the device seems well built. We will see how it performs over
the long haul and as I start using it on an everyday basis. I will try to keep
you all updated on it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the most part, I have been pretty satisfied with Time Machine over the
past few months since I have been using it. I have only been backing up my
desktop system as it was the only one tethered to my MyBook drive. I hated the
idea of having to plug my and my wife&#8217;s MacBook in everytime we needed to
backup (takes the setup and forget fun out of it). When I heard about the Time
Capsule from the announcement a little while ago, I was very excited and knew
I would be the proud owner of one when it came out.</p>

<p>Well Time Capsule came out a few days ago and arrived in our local Apple
Stores today. I rushed out this morning and picked up the massive Terabyte
networked drive + Airport Extreme (which is what the Time Capsule is if you
didn&#8217;t know). I hooked it up, with the only hitch being that I had to restart
my cable modem. After that it worked flawlessly and I was able to start
backing up to it immediately.</p>

<p>Here are some photos of the device in all of its glory:
<a href="http://gallery.mac.com/kyle.d.hayes#100163">http://gallery.mac.com/kyle.d.hayes#100163</a></p>

<p>As for the PC compatibility, I will let you know when I try it out. But
supposedly the think looks like a standard network drive. In addition, since
it is an Airport Extreme, it does have a usb port that I can hook a hub up to
if I wanted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep, that&#8217;s right. Thanks to the handy-dandy site <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com">RetailMeNot.com</a> I found
a coupon code for 10% off any Adobe product sold in the online store. If your
math is right, you will see that this makes the PRO upgrade at about $270
instead of $300. While you are at it, you might as well purchase the Creative
Suite Web Premium bundle for $50 off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many developers have the question of how to define the infamous connections to
the various AMF gateways to which they need to communicate through to their
server-side code. The process, while usually handled through the famed
services-config.xml file, can actually be handled directly in your
ActionScript very easily.</p>

<p>The examples below are showing connecting to a AMFPHP endpoint as opposed to a
ColdFusion one, only because that is what I have been learning and working on
recently. For ColdFusion, simply replace the latter part of the string with
<em>/flex2gateway/</em></p>

<p>First, define a new string in your model that references the URI to which you
are going to connect with your RemoteObjects:</p>

<p><code>var endpointUri:String = "http://mysite.com:8000/amfphp/gateway.php";</code></p>

<p>Then, simply define a new ChannelSet, and Channel to add to the ChannelSet
that references your URI:</p>

<p><code>var cs:ChannelSet = new ChannelSet(); var customChannel:Channel = new
AMFChannel("my-amfphp", endpointUri); cs.addChannel(customChannel);</code></p>

<p>Finally, define your RemoteObject to access this ChannelSet that you just
created and set the destination to the name you gave your AMFChannel:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>It is as simple as that! Be sure to take out the services-config declaration
in your compiler arguments to test this out appropriately.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After <a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/2008/02/why-adobe-air.php">Ted</a> posted his AIR entry on his blog and talked about the various
great things about the runtime, he also mentioned that it is important to
purchase a signed certificate from companies such as Thawte in order to get
the &#8220;greatly expanded APIs&#8221;, I immediately pinged <a href="http://www.digitalbackcountry.com/">Ryan</a> to confirm this
since Ted was not immediately available.</p>

<p>Shocked, Ryan went to check and reported back that it was not the case. Since
then, I noticed that the misinformation has been removed from Ted&#8217;s blog.</p>

<p>The actual question I posed to Ryan was if he thought the $300 certificate
cost from Thawte would discourage the development of open source and free
applications. He didn&#8217;t think so due to the ability to self-sign your own
applications, however, at the cost of them being labeled as &#8220;UNVERIFIED&#8221; when
the user installs them. Is there a way around this? Such as a certificate for
open source applications to encourage this ever-increasingly popular movement?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>W00T!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I am so happy that the final releases of the long awaited <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Adobe Flex 3 (and
builder)</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">AIR SDK</a> are here. And they have a couple of other cool
bits and pieces about them to go with this major update to the famed leading
RIA platform.</p>

<p>First of all, as you can <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/buyflexbuilder_std">see at the store</a>, the upgrade price is only $99!
Also, if you have a keen eye, you will notice that it is no longer a separate
license for PC and Mac&#8230;they come together now!</p>

<p>This is huge news and is truly making Flex be even more affordable and better
than ever. One thing to note, is that the $99 upgrade is for Flex Builder 3.0
standard. Chock up an additional $200 and you&#8217;ve got the Pro version which
includes advanced charting components and testing tools.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Flex framework is still free and open source. The prices
above are for the Flex Builder 3.0 IDE products.</p>

<p>Be sure to <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/flexteam/">thank the Flex team for all their hard work!</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Reading through my blog roll this morning I came across an interesting post
that was shared by <a href="http://arstechnica.com/authors.ars/Clintology">Clint Ecker</a> on <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a>. It was about a neat
(probably mostly useless but cool nontheless) service that will turn your RSS
feeds into a printable PDF whose content resembles that of the style and
layout of a newspaper.</p>

<p>An example of mine is below:</p>

<p>The site is called <a href="http://www.feedjournal.com">Feed Journal</a>. I suppose the main advantage that I can
see is that folks who commute and perhaps do not have the luxury of wireless
access on the road, could print this out in the mornings and pretty much read
it like a newspaper.</p>

<p>On a side note, it would be interesting to see all the coding in the backend
to actually generate the PDF itself. From the looks of it, after a 10 second
overview of the site, they are using ASP.NET as the middle-tier. I bet they
could have done it much more efficiently had they used CF :-P</p>
