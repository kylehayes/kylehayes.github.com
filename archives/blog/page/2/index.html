  <div class="entry-content"><p>After converting a white MacBook to our home media center, I decided the
footprint was too large to lay flat with the clamshell closed on our TV stand.
I came across the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LARBWM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cf0d-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002LARBWM">Twelve South BookArc</a> <img class="left" src="http://www.twelvesouth.com/static/assets/products/product/main_left_image/productImage_bapro.jpg" width="50"> and thought it would be the
perfect solution to stand the MacBook on end to take up less space. However,
at $50, I felt the price was a bit steep.</p>

<p><a href="http://kylehayes.info/files/2011/01/IMG_7929.jpg"><img src="http://kylehayes.net.kylehayes.info/files/2011/01/IMG_7929-150x150.jpg" alt="" /></a>Thinking how I could do something similar with items I already had
around the house, I thought of using a pair of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6CT8A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cf0d-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001E6CT8A" title="Metal Economy Bookends">metal economy bookends</a>
that I seem to have a plethora of in my home office. Note that I&#8217;m using a
particular style of bookend that has a whole in the middle with the base bent
down and out.</p>

<p><a href="http://kylehayes.info/files/2011/01/IMG_7938.jpg"><img src="http://kylehayes.net.kylehayes.info/files/2011/01/IMG_7938-150x150.jpg" alt="" /></a>Place one bookend on top of the other&#8217;s base and slide them close
together, leaving enough room to stand the MacBook up vertically between the
two ends. Take the MacBook (or any notebook) and place it vertically between
the two stands and slide them together to hold the notebook in place.</p>

<p><a href="http://kylehayes.info/files/2011/01/IMG_7946.jpg"><img src="http://kylehayes.net.kylehayes.info/files/2011/01/IMG_7946-150x150.jpg" alt="" /></a>I used bookends that are about five inches in height which seem to
hold the MacBook fairly efficiently. You could also get some black felt and
glue it on the side of the bookends that touch the computer for better
friction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve recently switched one of our big projects at work over to Git from
Perforce recently. Overall, its been good but has had quite the learning curve
for all of us to shift to this new paradigm. One of the things we&#8217;ve struggled
with a lot is just being able to easily see what&#8217;s changed in our commits,
comparing branch to branch etc. I&#8217;m always looking for ways to slice through
the information that git will report back.</p>

<p>I came across an interesting feature of git log yesterday. It allows you to
pass a simple grep string to the git log command and only the commits that
contain that string in their changeset description will be returned. This is
handy for us since we label all of our descriptions with our Version One story
or task ID.</p>

<p>The command is straightforward in its usage:</p>

<p>git log —grep=<grep_string></p>

<p>This turns what could be an unwieldy output of git log commits to a simple
eloquent output of a single (or shorter list) of commits:</p>

<p>$ git log &#8211;grep=B-03725</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know it is cliché to write a post about trying a new service that posts but
I gotta do it to give it a swing! I used to be a very frequent blogger over at
kylehayes.info in my ColdFusion days, but haven&#8217;t touched it much lately
because of how busy I&#8217;ve been. I figured if I can just send an email to write
a post about something, I just might be more apt to blog more frequently.
Although, that could mean that the quality of my content goes down, who knows,
we&#8217;ll see!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s no surprise that I&#8217;m a huge advocate and fan of the <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org" title="DojoToolkit.org">Dojo toolkit</a>
when it comes to quality JavaScript development. It consistently delivers
quality results in my websites and web applications while also helping to keep
my code very maintainable and reusable. However, it&#8217;s also no surprise that
Dojo is not the most popular JavaScript toolkit. This is due to many factors,
one of which is the lack of strong marketing. It&#8217;s my desire to help and
support the Dojo team where I can especially in this area since it lacks so
much by offering a free newsletter to subscribers over at <a href="http://startdojo.com/?cmp=khnlpromo" title="Sign up for the free newsletter at StartDojo.com">StartDojo.com</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Christian Hellman wrote another excellent JavaScript article over at <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing
Magazine</a>. This time he addresses styles and techniques of coding that is
widely supported, accepted, and expected by good JavaScript developers. If
you’ve been programming JavaScript for awhile, you’ll notice much of the stuff
is different now than it was less than a decade ago now that JavaScript has
evolved and improved based on the  needs of the JavaScript community as well
as the capabilities of modern-day browsers.</p>

<p>Personally, the ones I’ve fallen victim to most recently are shortcut
notations. Having a Java background, I always wanted to create new Objects and
Arrays using the “new” keyword and constructing. During the writing of
<a href="http://startdojo.com/buy">Getting Started with Dojo</a>, Peter Higgins (the technical reviewer) pounded
in my head that today, objects are created like var foo = {} and arrays are
created like var bar = []. Christian discusses this in the article (and a bit
more in detail).</p>

<p>Using JSON as a data format is another one I can strongly relate to,
especially with his mention of using arrays and delimited strings in the past.
Today, there will not be a project that goes by where I need data brought in
and I will always choose JSON if it’s available due to its native support in
modern day JavaScript.</p>

<p>I personally am always looking for ways to make my JavaScript run faster. As
developers, we so often get caught up in the moment of getting something to
work and simply implement a solution in a way that just came natural and was
easy, we don’t go back to see if we can make it more efficient—especially in
terms of browser memory usage. There have been many times I’ve seen a simple
for loop accessing data in a way that is calling another method to fetch the
data, instead of caching the data once and accessing the local cache.
Christian brought up another way to make your page more efficient in terms of
events that I had not thought of. His example perfectly illustrates a
situation in which you want to listen for the click event on a set of list
items inside an unordered list. Instead of looping through each list item and
adding an event handler, you can simply add an event handler to the parent of
this list (the ul). From here you can determine which li was clicked. This
assuming that you understand that events in the DOM roll up from the bottom
when an event occurs. This means that if you click an li,if that click is not
handled on the li, it will roll up to the ul and so forth.</p>

<p>Finally the last few points on anonymous functions with the module pattern,
configuration, interacting with the back end, and browser specific code, I
cannot stress enough to read and understand these the best you can. These four
points that he clearly makes are utterly important in ensuring you are an
efficient JavaScript developer. This will set you apart from being a good
JavaScript dev, to an excellent JavaScript dev—proving you know how the
language works and how to best control it and use it as it should be used.</p>

<p>I highly respect Christian’s articles and his advice and I recommend you head
his comments where you see fit. You can read the full article on Smashing
Magazine below:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With all the buzz of HTML5, most of it has been centered around the new video
and canvas tags, however, so much more is being added and spec’ed out. One
particular area that has been given some much needed love is forms.</p>

<p>Some new form input types that we get are:</p>

<ul>
<li>search</li>
<li>tel</li>
<li>url</li>
<li>email</li>
<li>datetime, date, month, week, time, and datetime-local</li>
<li>number</li>
<li>range</li>
<li>color</li>
</ul>


<p>Along with that, some validation. But what browsers are supporting this new
functionality? Check out the litmus tests here: <a href="http://cl.ly/4Bq">http://cl.ly/4Bq</a></p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>See if your browser passes the HTML5 &#8220;Acid&#8221; test: <a href="http://html5test.com/">http://html5test.com/</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Part of agile software development is the practice of acceptance testing to
ensure the appropriate business requirements, use cases, and ensure confidence
in the delivered product. This process is commonly recommended to be automated
so the tests can be easily run at a given time as well as be consistent. James
Shore created and encouraged the agile community to use his automated testing
framework (Fit) to create these tests.</p>

<p>The problem is that it was meant for the business to be creating these tests,
not the developers, however, it turns out that the developers were tasked with
creating them instead which is a “maintenance burden”.</p>

<p>Shore now believes that automating the acceptance testing is <em>not</em> a good
idea, summarized by the following two points:</p>

<p>1.       The real planned benefit of an automated acceptance tool, like Fit,
was that the business folks (&#8220;customers&#8221;) would write executable examples
themselves. History has shown that very rarely occurs. In a few cases testers
do, but in the majority of cases these tests are written by the developers.</p>

<p>2.       These tests often become a real maintenance burden, as they are slow
and brittle, and often hard to refactor. On this point, that end-to-end
&#8220;integration tests&#8221; present a higher cost than they are worth, JB Rainsberger
has a <a href="http://jbrains.ca/category/named/integrated-tests-are-a-scam">great series of articles</a> explaining his rational why.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came across a neat site called dummyimage.com that allows you to append an
image size to it&#8217;s URL as so: <a href="http://dummyimage.com/300x250">http://dummyimage.com/300x250</a>. However,
what I didn&#8217;t like about it, is that I could not add text to the image to
describe what the image is a placeholder for. I took upon myself to create my
own service that does this and I plan on expanding it to do more as well.</p>

<p>Last night I created <a href="http://fpoimg.com">fpoimg.com</a>. It works in very much the same way as
dummyimage.com, only you can add text to your images. The next iteration of
the site will allow you to change the colors of the background and foreground.
Anyway, the way you use the site is if you want to create a basic placeholder
or FPO (For Placement Only) image you simply go to
<a href="http://fpoimg.com/345x480">http://fpoimg.com/345x480</a> and the image will be provided to you. You can
save this image if you like, or you can refer to it directly in your code such
as in an image tag: <code>&lt;img src="http://fpoimg.com/345x480"&gt;</code></p>

<p>The first number is your width in pixels, the second is your height in pixels.
Additionally, if you want to add some text to the image to describe it as a
placeholder, you simply append that to the URL as so:
<a href="http://fpoimg.com/200x200/Advertisement">http://fpoimg.com/345x480/Advertisement</a></p>

<p>This will create the following image:</p>

<p><img src="http://fpoimg.com/345x480/Advertisement" alt="" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s really that basic! Here are some more examples: <img src="http://fpoimg.com/300x250/MREC" alt="" /> <img src="http://fpoimg.com/728x90/Banner" alt="" /></p>

<p>I of course do plan on tweaking this service as needed such as caching the
images and providing the ability to change their colors. If the service
becomes more popular, I have a feeling I&#8217;ll need to invoke some kind of limit
as well so as not to crash the server.</p>

is complete as the book is now officially published and out in the wild. While
the actual publish date was December 28th, I&#8217;m sure it will be a little while
before you start seeing it on the shelves of popular brick and mortar
bookstore shelves such as Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble. For now, you can
