  <div class="entry-content"><p>A very common practice in Java when you want to persist or save the current
state of your application to a physical file is known as serialization or
serializing an object. What this basically means is that you are taking the
machine code that represents an object in your application, and converting it
to a format that can be written to a file.</p>

<p>The benefits of serialization is that you maintain the actual instance of the
object&#8211;not just a data representation of the object. When you read the
serialized file back in to the application, it reads in as a native object to
that application.</p>

<p>Traditionally in web applications, we accommodate this need by writing entries
in a database. Even when it comes down to session information. For the most
part, this is fine, works great and I would recommend it for the majority of
use cases. However, the serialization method described above could be used as
a more efficient means to storing the state of a rich Internet application.
Such a method is possible in ActionScript to use in your Flex application.</p>

<p>The high level process is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Represent your data model as an ActionScript object</li>
<li>Serialize your data model into the same AMF format that is used to communicate with middle-tiers like ColdFusion</li>
<li>Send the raw AMF message packet to ColdFusion in a RemoteObject call, or similar</li>
<li>ColdFusion writes the message packet to a local file on the server</li>
</ol>


<p>Naturally, you would create this functionality in a series of classes and
CFCs. In ActionScript, you will be using the Flash ByteArray class. This class
converts any ActionScript object into a ByteArray which is basically
serializing the object.</p>

<p><code>var bytes:ByteArray = new ByteArray(); bytes.writeObject(myDataModel);</code></p>

<p>From this point, <strong>bytes</strong> can now be sent to ColdFusion to be written to a
file. If you are using ColdFusion, you will want your service function to be
expecting an arguments of type=&#8221;Binary&#8221;. From there, ColdFusion can encode the
Binary into a writable format like Base64. You migh have a function that looks
something like the following:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>It is really that easy. Once you call the save function you will notice that
file now exists on the server. If you were to open it, it would just be a
series of what appears to be random data.</p>

<p>To read that data back into a usable object in Flex, you will need to setup a
service call to ColdFusion to return the binary data from the file.</p>

<p>On the ColdFusion side, the code would look something like this: `</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>And your ActionScript RemoteObject handler would probably have the following:
<code>private function myRO_handler(event:ResultEvent):void { var
myDataModel:Object = ByteArray(event.result).readObject(); }</code></p>

<p>Obviously, the above code is very procedural still since the functionality is
not encapsulated within well-defined functions. It is only meant to serve as a
basis for understanding the concept. For your convenience, and quite frankly
for mine as well, I have created an ActionScript class as well as a set of
ColdFusion components to encapsulate all this functionality. You may download
the files below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t normally post off-topic entries but this story hit me hard and I want
to help. I also want you to help to make a difference for this poor man.</p>

<p>An innocent man and his loving dog were the recent targets of a possible
deadly threat from two young children in Philadelphia. His dog, Edna, went
missing on Halloween night. After posting &#8220;Dog Missing&#8221; signs with a $500
reward, he received a phone call days later at midnight from a child asking
for a ransom of $600 or he would kill his dog. Bill Whiting heard the collar
of his dog in the background and some animal yelps. Immediately he agreed to
the ransom and the kid responded that he was going to kill the dog anyway.</p>

<p>You can read the rest of the story in detail below: <a href="http://www.suburbanchicagonews.com/newssun/news/727940,WA06_edna_s1.article">http://www.suburbanchicag

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, I didn&#8217;t even expect this, but I was nominated for a CFEmmy for Best
Newcomer. Thank you to those of you that nominated me. <a href="http://cfsilence.com/soundings/survey.cfm?id=EDCDE15B-FF9E-13A7-FC217BCDEDB0CC25">Vote Now</a> for your
favorite blog, host, OS project, community site, and more.</p>

<p>Thank you to Todd Sharp for conducting this once again this year. And thanks
again to those who nominated me for Best Newcomer. Whether I win or not, I can
surely say that this has truly been a great experience. When I graduated from
college I set a goal for myself to be active in this incredible community.
Without all of your help I would not be where I am today. You all are always
so willing to help and I truly appreciate it and the only way I can repay is
to give back what I have learned to the community.</p>

<p>Have a great Christmas and Holiday season!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are writing a function in ColdFusion that accepts a custom typed array
(com.hayes.project.component[] for example) and you don&#8217;t want to make it
required because it may not be provided, you can still use the default
argument with an untyped array:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>I was worried that it may error out when it used the default function to
create a new untyped Array. Once I thought about it, I decided to give it a
try and sure enough it works great.</p>

<p>One thing to note, however, that <a href="http://coldfusionjedi.com"></a>Ray mentioned to me was that ColdFusion
is lazy when it comes to validating typed Arrays. It only checks the first
element in the array to make sure it is of the type you specified.</p>

<p>To overcome this shortfall, when you are looping through the array and
accessing the elements&#8217; functions, simply wrap it in a try/catch in case the
elements after the first one are not of the appropriate type.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At work today I was trying to search for sites that use the Atlassian
Confluence wiki software. The product prints their name at the bottom of wiki
pages so I figured I would be able to get a decent amount of results from
simply typing <strong>atlassian confluence</strong> into Google. However, since that is
verbatim the name of the company and product, I was getting a lot of hits from
the Atlassian.com website.</p>

<p>I then decided I needed a way to not show any atlassian.com website. I don&#8217;t
consider myself a Google query guru, but I know about the site: parameter
where you can type site:disney.com or something to search only that site. So I
thought, what if I put the minus in front of that and maybe it would search
everywhere but that site.</p>

<p>Sure enough, it worked! Check it out:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other day I attended an internal Flex user group meeting at Boeing. The
noticed that throughout the meeting, the host was pasting TinyURLs into the
chat window for the attendees to click on to various websites that were being
discussed.</p>

<p>This instantly gave me an idea of an AIR app that would allow a user to drag
and drop a URL from their browser onto the AIR application and have it
retrieve a TinyURL. My main goal of this application, besides it usefulness,
was to really show the rapid application development capabilities of Adobe
Flex + AIR in creating a desktop application. As soon as I got home from work
that day, I began working on it.</p>

<p>With about an hour development that day, and total of 1 hour of development
the next day (Thanksgiving) I had a fully working AIR application that did
exactly what I needed it to do. I am already finding it quite useful to use
and am sure you will to. You may use the installer below if you would like to
download and install the Adobe AIR Framework and TinyMe together:</p>

<p>Flash badge has been removed due to the new release of AIR Beta 3.</p>

<p>If the installer does not work, you may <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air.html">download Adobe AIR Beta 2</a>. Once
you have installed Adobe AIR Beta 2, you may <a href="http://www.kylehayes.info/tinyme/TinyMe_beta.air">download and install TinyMe</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Firefox 2 Mac does not work at this time with TinyMe. The issue with
Firefox 2 on the Mac has been fixed.</p>
