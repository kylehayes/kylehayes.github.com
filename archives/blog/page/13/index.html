ColdFusionBloggers since all the aggregators had some. I hoped he would elect
me to do them when I suggested this, and he did. So here are a couple of
badges that I made yesterday for you to plop down on your blog and support the

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In anticipation of a final release of Mach-II 1.5 before MAX in October, the
latest beta has earned release candidate status. Many bugs and issues have
been fixed in this build as well as another feature. You can now use relative
paths when using the new include feature (new to 1.5) or when referencing
module configs.</p>

<p>The Mach-II team continues to make progress in development towards version
1.6, providing developers with such features as specialized advanced caching
as well as a new Mach-II dashboard to allow reloading parts of your
applications easier.</p>

<p>Excellent progress is being made and will continue to be made. Head on over to
<a href="http://www.mach-ii.com">Mach-II.com</a> to learn more and to download the latest release 1.5RC.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I woke up this morning to write a blog entry and to my dismay, my website
was gone. I immediately recognized the placeholder site as a typical domain
expired page. I am really good at renewing my domains, when I saw this I could
not believe it!</p>

<p>I thought I had transferred all my domains to <a href="http://www.namecheap.com">NameCheap.com</a>, whom I have
had great service from, but it seems I missed one&#8230;one very important domain.
I looked it up and it was still with the crappy <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=registerfly+sucks&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">RegisterFly registrar</a>.</p>

<p>I knew this company was in a lot of trouble and has been for a couple of years
now. Nonetheless I did some digging and some research. It turns out, not only
has this company lost their <a href="http://www.icann.org">ICANN</a> accreditation, but they are also not
really in the business anymore.</p>

<p>Then I read that all the domains that were in the database for RegisterFly
were supposed to be transferred to GoDaddy. I gave them a few calls and they
did not have record of the domain. They informed me that only some of the
domains were transferred to them, and the others were kept at the respective
company&#8217;s that RegisterFly has resold from.</p>

<p>That meant for me, <a href="http://www.enom.com">eNom</a>. After numerous calls and waiting and patience, I
was finally able to get the domain transferred for eNom to control completely
and get the domain paid for and renewed. Happily, everything is up and running
now and I have definitely learned my lesson.</p>

<p>By the way, what registrars do you all like out there?</p>

ColdFusion 8 now. I can really see the difference in speed increase on this

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230; that is in the world of Google searches. Take a look at the following
chart: <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=coldfusion%2C+actionscript&amp;ctab=0&amp;hl=en&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0">Google Trends: ColdFusion vs. ActionScript</a></p>

<p>I find it very interesting that the two languages literally crossed paths.
Seems to be around the time that Flex became more popular.</p>

<p>Any comments on this? I am just curious to some general thoughts and musings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>The Adobe Flash Player is a multimedia application created by Macromedia
(now a division of Adobe Systems). Flash Player features support for both
vector and raster graphics, along with a scripting language and bidirectional
streaming of video and audio content. The player is a virtual machine that
runs Flash files, which are often embedded in websites to present animations,
games, GUIs, or other visual interestingness. If you&#8217;re reading this website,
you probably know all of this. What you might not know is that Flash sucks. It
is the bane of the Internet, and it needs to go away.</p></blockquote>

<p>Did I get your attention? I saw an article on the <a href="http://digg.com/programming/Why_Flash_Sucks">Digg</a> and had to read it
due to my love and loyalty for Adobe and Macromedia. After reading the
article, I agreed with what Mike was saying about some of the stuff, but for
the most part, I really feel it is the developer&#8217;s fault for creating, what he
calls, &#8220;sucky&#8221; sites. Any tools put into the hands of the wrong person will
result in garbage.</p>

<p>He cannot blame the platform saying that it sucks because it allows people to
create &#8220;sucky&#8221; stuff. If it was the platforms fault, then we could certainly
say just about this of any technology on the Internet. Look at all those sucky
HTML pages in the past with flashing backgrounds, movings
sentences/images/tables, intricate background textures and table borders up
the ying yang.</p>

<p>Saying that Flash sucks because of the reasons he gives is just simply
ridiculous. Anybody else have any comments on the matter?</p>

<p>If you agree with me, please bury this article on Digg:

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/share/tivohd.gif" alt="" />After my wife and I purchased our new LG 42&#8221; LCD HDTV in February this
year, we quickly realized that our less than 6 month old Tivo Series2 was not
going to suffice in quality for recording programs.</p>

<p>We are both huge Tivo brand fans and really enjoy using the service.
Especially with my wife&#8217;s odd and unpredictable work schedule, it really suits
us well. After scoffing at the price of a new Tivo Series3 which does support
HD, we decided against it and to wait for a really slammin deal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we decided to use the built in HD DVR that came integrated with our
LG screen. We figured this would be great, until we discovered all the
downfalls that it had. Things like</p>

<ul>
<li>Not being able to resume your recorded program if you stop and come back</li>
<li>Halt you from viewing a recorded program if one was recording at the same time and it finishes recording</li>
<li>Really bad searching and scheduling</li>
<li>Uses the integrated TV Guide interface which is clumsy, slow, and unorganized</li>
<li>Etc, etc, etc</li>
</ul>


<p>Needless to say, when I heard about the release of the Tivo HD last week, I
was very very excited&#8211;especially when I saw the $300 price tag, compared to
the $600 tag of the Series3 (from Amazon.com, retail is $800).</p>

<p>It is built on the Series3 technology. The only major thing that it differs
from the Series3 is 10 less hours of HD recording time (putting it at about 20
hours I believe) and it only works with those who subscribe to Cable service
(sorry satellite folks).</p>

<p>We went out to Best Buy last night and purchased it, and are loving it. We are
so happy to have it back!</p>

<p>I may post more reviews about it, as I use it more, but so far it is really
quite wonderful. Oh and by the way, there is a port on the back labeled eSATA
- External Storage&#8230;<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/04/how-to-use-your-tivo-series3-esata-port-to-add-an-external-driv/">hmmmmm</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After noodling around in <a href="http://kevinlangdon.com/serviceCapture/">Service Capture</a> to watch the calls that were
being made from the Pownce AIR file, I began working on a CFC to interact with
the unofficial Pownce API.</p>

<p>After numerous attempts and a great deal of pain figuring out as well as <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pownceapi/browse_thread/thread/777102ccebad37e1">help
from the newly created PownceAPI Google Group</a>, I got my CFC to work.</p>

<p>Currently you can only get all your notes from Pownce. But this is a great
start! The hardest part about that was the password digest authentication
string that you have to pass to Pownce. Everything else is just a matter of
method calls.</p>

<p>I dropped the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cfpownce/">project into Google Code</a> as well as <a href="http://cfpownce.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a>.</p>

<p>My planned features for this are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add ability to post notes</li>
<li>Add ability to post links</li>
<li>Add ability to post files</li>
<li>Get only specific notes by date, type etc.</li>
<li>Build a HTML webpage client</li>
<li>Build a Flex webpage client</li>
