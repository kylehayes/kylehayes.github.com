    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, at least for now, I've decided that I was tired of dealing with Wordpress. In an effort to lower my costs and headache for owning and operating a personal blog, Octopress paired with Jekyll seemed like an awesome alternative for someone who enjoys writing in plain text as much as myself.</p>

<p>I was <a href="http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/switching-to-octopress">inspired</a> by a couple of <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/">folks</a> to make the switch. All in all, it was actually not too bad once I got the latest version of Ruby and RVM <a href="http://brandonbohling.com/2011/08/27/Installing-Jekyll-on-Mac/">setup on my Mac</a>.</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em></p>

<p>It's also worthy to note that I used <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp">exitwp</a> to migrate my wordpress content into markdown. I realize there are a few bugs that I need to iron out and will do that soon.</p>

<p>Furthermore, check out <a href="http://pages.github.com/">http://pages.github.com/</a> if you are ever interested in free static stite hosting on github. Seems pretty good for a personal blog setup.</p>
