  <div class="entry-content"><p>Refer to the following links for some background on the current &#8220;blacks&#8221; issue
on the new iPod Touches: <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/c.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fdiscussions.apple.com%2Fthread.jspa%3FthreadID%3D1131324%26tstart%3D0&amp;t=1190068204">Apple thread</a>, <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=355803">MacRumors thread</a>, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/c.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fflickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fmacpublishing%2Fsets%2F72157602019608287%2F&amp;t=1190068204">Flickr

<p>Just got back from the Apple Store in the Irvine Spectrum Center in Irvine, CA
to get this issue &#8220;confirmed&#8221; by them. Luckily I was able to walk in without
an appointment and a genius helped me out right away. I had set Heroes episode
2 to about 16 seconds in to the show where the problem was quite obvious.</p>

<p>Steve, the genius, noticed that his direct halogen light in the store was
making the issue appear less severe and took into the back room. About five
minute later, he returned and did confirm that it had an obvious issue.
Unfortunately, they did not have any in stock (no where in Orange County
really) and he gave me his card instead and wrote on the back that it did
indeed need to be swapped and the issue was verified.</p>

<p>He told me that I could check with them on another day or if another Apple
Store had them in stock that they would happily replace it.</p>

<p>So it was rather funny when I began calling the other 4 stores in my area. One
of them, Brea, CA, laughed and said &#8220;Irvine Spectrum already got a shipment of
Touches?&#8221; I told him that actually I had bought it at Mission Viejo. He then
proceeded to say that his store never received a first shipment of them.</p>

<p>Finally I proceeded to find a store that really was willing to help me out in
my time of need. The Apple store of Fashion Island in Newport Beach said they
didn&#8217;t have any in today, but to call back in the morning and if they had them
in stock, they would be more than willing to put it on hold to get swap it out
with mine (and of course the business card from the other store).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I cross my fingers and continue to enjoy the other nice things
about this unit. I am going to be a trooper for as long as I can, because I
trust that Apple will fix the issue and provide the best support I have always
known and loved from them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In years past there have been many times that I wanted to easily print a
listing of the files in a given directory. For example, whenever I do a
restore of any system, I would like to have a record of all the applications I
had installed prior to reformatting. This is actually the main use I have for
such an operation, but there are times when I need to print a file listing
from a specific directory as well.</p>

<p>Lately I have been learning more of the INs and OUTs of the UNIX part of my OS
X machines. I have little knowledge of some basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell">Shell</a> commands and
wanted to increase my knowledge of a better working knowledge of UNIX. I went
out and purchased an excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321374118?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cf0d-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321374118">Mac OS X Unix 101 Byte-Sized
Projects</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=cf0d-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321374118" alt="" />. It is here that l learned a little trick known as a
&#8220;pipeline&#8221;.</p>

<p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know what this is, it is basically a way of
passing the output of one command to another. You can string these together
collectively creating a pipeline. The name comes from the pipe character ( | )
which separates each command.</p>

<p>With that knowledge, I created a easy way to print out directories. On your
Mac (I am sure it is similar on PC) open up your Terminal
(Applications/Utilities/Terminal) and type in the following command:</p>

<p><code>ls /Applications | Mate</code></p>

<p><strong>Breakdown:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>ls: the command to display the contents of a specified directory</li>
<li>/Application: the directory to be listed</li>
<li>| Mate (pipe Mate): The command that takes the output of ls /Applications and <em>pipes</em> it to TextMate. Mate could also be replaced with &#8216;edit&#8217; if you have TextWrangler installed.</li>
</ul>


<p>Once you do that, the appropriate application opens with the output inside and
you can print the file from there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About 2 months ago or so, I had the need for placing some sexy Flex 2 badges
on an application I was working that proudly stated <em>Powered by Flex 2</em>. After
going around and finding out that none exist I pinged <a href="http://www.riapedia.com">Mike Potter</a> to see
if any existed. I was saddened when he said no but then he told me to go for
it and make some community ones.</p>

<p>They have been sitting around unpublished until now. Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the release of ColdFusion 8, came a whole new set of long-awaited <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/cfimage.html">tags
and functions for image manipulation</a>. Developers can now easily read,
manipulate, create images as well as create captchas.</p>

<p>Thanks to the release of the brand new <a href="http://foundeo.com/image-effects/">CFImageEffects CFC</a> <a href="http://foundeo.com/">by
Foundeo</a>, you can now do even more with images that blows <a href="http://www.php.net/">other
languages&#8217;</a> image capabilities even further out of the water.</p>

<p>I am going to be starting a mini-series on the use of this fantastic addition
to your CF 8 library of code.</p>

<p>The first example that I cooked up fairly quickly (thanks to the excellent
documentation) was a page to test the <em>reflection</em> effect as well as the
<em>rounded corners</em> effect on a photo.</p>

<p>Lab Url: <a href="http://www.kylehayes.info/imageeffects/">http://www.kylehayes.info/imageeffects/</a></p>

<p>The demonstration allows you to choose an effect to apply to the photo and to
tweak the basic effect settings. In this case, the reflection height, and the
rounded corners radius. Give it a try and leave your feedback and what you
think about the speed of the product. I think Pete has done an excellent job
on this component. If you are interested in getting this for your own website,
check out <a href="http://foundeo.com/image-effects/">Foundeo&#8217;s ImageEffects product page</a>.</p>

<p>My next implementation idea for this is to allow the user to select multiple
effects at a time and choose the order in which the effects are applied.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many of the popular programming languages such as Java, C#, Visual Basic, C,
C++ pass objects around in much the same manner&#8211;either by reference or by
value. This is quite familiar to anyone who has a background in the above
languages.</p>

<p>For those of you that don&#8217;t understand, it is important that you do. Here is a
quick explanation. Applications store their variables inside the computer&#8217;s
memory, and they can get access to those pieces of data in memory, by giving
the computer an address of where that data is located. For example, if you
create the string &#8220;Hello World&#8221; and save it to the variable <strong>greeting</strong>, the
computer stores the value of <strong>greeting</strong> in memory and the variable itself
has the address to that data.</p>

ColdFusionBloggers since all the aggregators had some. I hoped he would elect

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In anticipation of a final release of Mach-II 1.5 before MAX in October, the
latest beta has earned release candidate status. Many bugs and issues have
been fixed in this build as well as another feature. You can now use relative
paths when using the new include feature (new to 1.5) or when referencing
module configs.</p>

<p>The Mach-II team continues to make progress in development towards version
1.6, providing developers with such features as specialized advanced caching
as well as a new Mach-II dashboard to allow reloading parts of your
applications easier.</p>

<p>Excellent progress is being made and will continue to be made. Head on over to
<a href="http://www.mach-ii.com">Mach-II.com</a> to learn more and to download the latest release 1.5RC.</p>
