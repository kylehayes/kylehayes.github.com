  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.morearty">Mike</a>, I was able to change my Flex builder to create a
ColdFusion HTML-Template in the bin directory, instead of an HTML template. I
needed to do this to accommodate passing URL or Query values to my Flex
application.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.morearty.com/blog/2006/12/11/changing-the-filenames-in-flex-builder-html-templates/trackback/">solution</a> that Mike provided gets 10 <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cool+points">cool points</a> for using Flex
Builder&#8217;s built-in <a href="http://www.morearty.com/blog/2007/01/24/macros-that-are-available-in-html-template-files/trackback/">macro functionality</a> to change the default html-
template output format from HTML to a ColdFusion (CFM) template file!</p>

<p>If you have ever delved into some of the project files that Flex uses you may
have noticed some variable-like parts of the file that usually look like
<strong>${some_keyword}</strong>. These items are little macro keywords that Flex Builder
checks for in specific files to replace them with appropriate data.</p>

<p>Mike said in <a href="http://www.morearty.com/blog/2006/12/11/changing-the-filenames-in-flex-builder-html-templates/trackback/">his post</a> that you cannot simply change the html-template
extension from <strong>html</strong> to <strong>cfm</strong> because of the way Flex Builder handles
that file. You need to find the file called <strong>index.template.html</strong> inside of
your <strong>html-template</strong> folder inside your current project&#8217;s folder. Once you
have found that file, rename it to:</p>

<p><code>${application}${build_suffix}.template.cfm</code></p>

<p>Next, you need to go to <strong>Project -> Clean</strong> in order for the changes to take
effect. However, you will be distraught when you go to <strong>Run</strong> your project
and see that now your browser displays a <strong>Page Cannot Be Found</strong> error. If
you check the URL that it is attempting to access the template file with an
<strong>html</strong> extension still. To correct this, close the browser and go into
<strong>Flex Builder</strong> and click the <strong>submenu arrow</strong> for the <strong>debug toolbar
button</strong> and <strong>Ctrl + Click</strong> the project you are working on. In the <strong>Debug
Properties</strong> pane you will notice that the values for the <strong>Debug</strong> and
<strong>Run</strong> paths are still pointing to an <strong>html</strong> file. Simple update those
paths to point to a <strong>cfm</strong> file instead. Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then <strong>Close</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to <strong>Clean</strong> (<strong>Project -> Clean</strong>) your project one more
time. <strong>Run</strong> your project now and all should be good. Once you have done
this, you will be able to do cool things like <a href="http://www.kylehayes.info/blog/index.cfm/2007/2/22/Passing-URL-Variables-To-Flex">pass URL or query variables
into your Flex project</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.thanksmister.com">Michael&#8217;s</a> post on <a href="http://thanksmister.com/wp-trackback.php?p=27">Passing variables to Flex 2 in the embed page (or URL
string)</a> really helped shed some light on this issue.</p>

<p>According to the docs, you <em>simply</em> pass the variable via the <strong>src</strong>
attribute in the wrapper OBJECT or EMBED tags. Unfortunately, this simply
isn&#8217;t true because if you open up the html-template file that Flex uses to
generate the HTML wrapper page, you will notice that tag is only for
&#8220;NOSCRIPT&#8221; browsers. If you want to change it for any modern browser, then you
actually need to pass it in the JavaScript in the header that generates the
Flash Object inside the function <strong>AC_FL_RunContent</strong>.</p>

<p>Be mindful that there are actually two functions that do this, the first one
is the object/embed tag for browsers that don&#8217;t have the latest Flash player.
You actually want to append the URL into the function inside the <strong>Else</strong>
statement. Simply append it to the <strong>FlashVars</strong> Name Value pair. Here is an
example:</p>

<p><code>"flashvars",'myVar=FOOBAR&amp;historyUrl=history.htm%3F&amp;lconid=' + lc_id + '',</code></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is no stopping it, the unstandardized high definition video disc
technologies have been released out into the open, with free reign and and
with every intention to compete with one and another to see who will gain the
largest market share as consumers eagerly jump on the 1080p advantage. With
<a href="http://www.toshiba.com">Toshiba</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.nec.com">NEC</a> and <a href="http://www.sanyo.com">Sanyo</a>, <a href="http://www.rca.com">RCA</a> and <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a>
backing the HD DVD format and <a href="http://www.sony.com">Sony</a>, <a href="http://www.hp.com">Hewlett-Packard</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple
Inc.</a>, <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a>, and <a href="http://www.panasonic.com">Panasonic</a> supporting the Blue-ray disc, there
is no telling what these technology giants have up their sleeves to joust the
other off their high horse.</p>

<p>Naturally, one would assume that the company with the bigger better product
would win the battle. With this scenario, Sony&#8217;s Blue-ray disc (BD) would
tower it&#8217;s rival in capacity as a single layer disc is only 5 gigabytes short
of the dual-layer option of HD DVD and the BD&#8217;s double-layer option is a
capacious 50 gigabytes. With this advantage alone the Blue-ray disc has a
tremendous lead. It would be one thing if the HD DVD technology could play on
existing DVD players. Unfortunately, this is not the case and for a consumer
who wants to upgrade to the new high definition home movie technology, either
format forces them to buy new proprietary equipment.</p>

<p>The next major item to compare is what major movie studios are supporting the
two formats. As of right now four Hollywood studios are exclusively supporting
the Blue-ray Disc: Columbia Pictures, MGM, Disney and 20th Century Fox. Three
Hollywood studios are supporting both formats: Paramount Pictures, Warner
Bros. and New Line Cinema. Finally, two hollywood studios exclusively support
HD DVD: Universal Studios and Weinstein Company. A layman&#8217;s tally would show
Blue-ray having the support of seven major Hollywood studios and HD DVD having
only five.</p>

<p>A trend will and has already started to occur and it is only a matter of time
that the exponential curve will take form. The issue here is not what format
will win and what technology leader will claim the throne of the high
definition optical disc standard, the issue is, what consumers are they going
to step on in the process. When the war is over, what are those consumers to
do that bet on the losing horse but to either stick with their undeveloped
movie collection and obsolete player or to once again rebuild and provide
money to the victorious challenger.</p>

<p>To the high definition home theater shopper, take heed when approaching this
war. It is quite a mess right now. It will phase out soon enough. My bid is on
the Blue-ray disc and <a href="http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Industry_Trends/Disc_Sales/Sonys_New_Blu-ray_Marketing_Message:_Format_War_is_Over/468">other&#8217;s may agree</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In keeping with the trend of Microsoft changing the license for Virtual PC
2004 to a free license, it announced today the release of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/virtualpc/default.mspx">Virtual PC 2007</a>
for free as well.</p>

<p>In the past, many looked at solutions such as VMWare as being a better
alternative to Virtual PC. This was due to VMWare&#8217;s optimized approach of
processing computational instructions. For instance, VMWare workstation will
work directly with the CPU&#8217;s processor when possible as opposed to
conventional emulators which only simulate the function of the CPU
instruction. This allows for a much speedier performance.</p>

<p>Now, according to <a href="http://www.betanews.com">BetaNews.com</a>, the newest version of Virtual PC &#8220;takes
advantage of new hardware virtualization technology from both Intel and AMD.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally with this release being a free license product, Microsoft duels
competing software companies such as <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</a> and <a href="http://www.parallels.com">Parallels</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/labs/archives/2007/02/adobe_photoshop_1.cfm">Adobe</a> announced today that one of the first products to hit Adobe Labs,
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/">Adobe Photoshop Lightroom</a>, is now shipping and is available for
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/buylightroom">purchase</a> on Adobe&#8217;s online store.</p>

<p>I am not an avid photographer so I have not used this software in great
length. However, the little bit that I did use it, I was only slightly
impressed. In comparison with Apple&#8217;s Aperture software, it was rather slow
and clunky. But then again, I used it a couple of versions ago, so hard to say
if they improved it or not.</p>

<p>Some of its nice features it the ability to handle RAW image formats from many
popular cameras. Although, recently my buddy who has one of the new <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos400d/">Canon
XLTi</a> said that when he dumped his CR2 RAW image files into Lightroom that
it failed in showing any images, rather it showed only red in place of the
photo.</p>

description to <a href="http://www.imified.com">IMified</a>, a new website that enables you to access isntant
ToDos and Notes, Google Calendar, and some other cool stuff without ever
opening the browser! Simply through the interface of instance messaging.</p>

<p>The really cool thing about this service is that it runs completely off of
ColdFusion MX 7 using the powerful built in feature of event gateways to
provide IM functionality. According to Ben, despite the large load of users
that has piled on to their system sinnce the launch of the site on February 5,
the service is running very smooth. In the words of partners Anthony Webb and
Dave Hoff, &#8220;we&#8217;ve brought to market a really slick and useful service and
couldn&#8217;t have done it, or at least as fast, without CF.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>ColdFusion makes it quite easy to work with what is known in many other
languages as associative arrays; ColdFusion calls them structs or structures.
A structure is a great datatype to work with as long as you know how to use
it.</p>

<p>One of the things that you must remember about this special datatype is
something that I ran into today when building a Validation CFC for a form I am
working on for a client.</p>

<p>First a little background&#8230;</p>

<p>In this component, I call a function called <strong>getData()</strong>. It is called after
the instantiation of the component when supplied with a <strong>formStruct</strong> which
contains all the form elements and values that were submitted.</p>

<p>During the course of the Validation process for a given form, I want to store
a little more information about each form element other than the <strong>name</strong> and
<strong>value</strong> (which is all that is provided when a user submits a form). My
getData() function extracts each form element and it&#8217;s value from the
structure and creates a new structure with attributes <strong>fieldName</strong>, <strong>data</strong>,
<strong>isValidEntry</strong>. The first two are self-explanatory, however, the third
attribute is a flag that specifies whether the form element is valid for it&#8217;s
specified data type (e.g. email, phone number, credit card etc.). This
attribute is initially set to <strong>true</strong> as it has not been validated just yet.</p>

<p>After the function extracts each form field into a separte structure, it
places them into an array that will contain all the form element structures.
This makes it quite easy to loop through all the data and validate it based on
the form element name.</p>

<p>Now that I have thoroughly introduced my situation, I will tell you about the
problem I came across. The following code is what my <strong>getData()</strong> function
looked like inside my Validation component:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>This appears that it would be correct and wouldn&#8217;t have any issues. Indeed
when I gave it a test, it did not error out, however, when I CFDUMP&#8217;ed the
array that was created, every single structure contained the EXACT same
information. In fact, it contained the data for my submit button. But &#8220;Why?&#8221;,
I asked.</p>

<p>Going back and looking at my code, I saw the line that read:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>It was at this point that it clicked. ColdFusion structures are passed to
functions <strong>BY REFERENCE</strong>. That means regardless where that structure get&#8217;s
passed, you are referring the actual structure in memory. No matter where it
is changed, it changes the original data and all references to it are updated.
Every time I was looping through each element in the array, I would change the
data in the original structure. And because I was simply passing the name of
structure in the arrayAppend function, only a reference to the structure was
being passed.</p>

<p>Naturally there a couple of ways around this. The first solution was the one I
went with, I had to rewrite my code as follows, creating a new structure on
each pass of the loop:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>Whilst writing this post, I realized that I probably could have just changed
the arrayAppend function to read:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>This would have created a shallow copy (only simple variables and arrays) of
the temporary structure. I may very well do this afterall.</p>

<p>The lesson here is, be aware of how ColdFusion deals with various data types.
Ensure that you know which data types are passed by reference and which are
