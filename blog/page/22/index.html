  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was greeted today by a <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com">post by Ray Camden from his blog</a> announcing that
he was launching his latest project (that has been under wraps for quite some
time), <a href="http://www.riaforge.org">RIAForge.org</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, a site where RIA developers that use Adobe technologies (among
others), can host their open-source projects.</p>

<p>The site provides such features as a blog, svn, and an issue tracker. The site
is built with other open source projects such as Ray&#8217;s BlogCFC, Galleon
forums, and Lighthouse Pro.</p>

<p>The design of the site, compliments of Adobe contractor Rick Santos, is very
clean and quite easy to use.</p>

<p>Here is a shoutout to Ray and his team, NICE JOB!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today at work I had the need to retrieve the data from a sheet in a Microsoft
Excel file. ColdFusion does not provide this functionality natively. <strong>Before
reading on, please note that to use the below syntax, you must be allowed to
create Java objects on your ColdFusion server.</strong> If this has been restricted
because you are on a shared host, than this solution will not work for you.</p>

<p>I have created a ready-made function that will take care of the dirty work
associated with getting a query from an Excel file. All you have to do is
provide the relative file name of the Excel file you would like to read, and
the name of a sheet within the Excel file that you would eventually like to
query.</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>var c = &#8220;&#8221;; var stmnt = &#8220;&#8221;; var rs = &#8220;&#8221;; var sql = &#8220;Select * from
[#sheetName#$]&#8221;; var myQuery = &#8220;&#8221;; arguments.filename =
expandPath(arguments.filename);</p>

<p>if(len(trim(arguments.filename)) and fileExists(arguments.filename)) { try { C
reateObject(&#8220;java&#8221;,&#8221;java.lang.Class&#8221;).forName(&#8220;sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver&#8221;);
c = CreateObject(&#8220;java&#8221;,&#8221;java.sql.DriverManager&#8221;).getConnection(&#8220;jdbc:odbc:Dri
ver={Microsoft Excel Driver (*.xls)};DBQ=&#8221; &amp; arguments.filename ); stmnt =
c.createStatement(); rs = stmnt.executeQuery(sql); myQuery =
CreateObject(&#8216;java&#8217;,&#8217;coldfusion.sql.QueryTable&#8217;).init(rs); } catch(any e) { //
error-handling code } } } return myQuery;</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>To execute the above code, you would simply call the function with the
appropriate information as so:</p>

<p><code>myQuery = getExcelSheet("/mydocs/foobar.xls","customers");</code></p>

<p>As you can see I had to delve into create a few Java objects. The JDBC ODBC
driver has support for reading Excel files which is what makes this all
possible. The rest is fairly self-explainable. If you need further
explanation, feel free to post a comment.</p>

to sign-up and give it a whirl. It is pretty easy to sign-up since all you
have to do is provide your email address. In addition, the site was created by
the Publisher&#8217;s Clearing House and they said that they will not spam you or
sell your email address. So I said, what the heck do I have to lose. I can
deal with a few more ads on a page for the chance of winning something.</p>

<p>I am sure it will pass as I always end up going back to plain ol&#8217; Google at
some point. But, what difference does it make.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.google.com/mac"><img src="http://www.google.com/sitesearch/mac.png" alt="" /></a>In an effort to become more &#8220;universally accessible and useful&#8221;,
Google hired a team of Mac developers not too long ago to take on the
challenge of bringing what Google has to offer and ensuring it is also
compatible with the Macintosh platform.</p>

<p>In the past, Google Earth, calendar, and Picasa related uploading was only
available on the PC. Since Google hired it&#8217;s Mac engineers, us Mac folks can
enjoy some more fun Google toys as well. First off, they have finally given
update to <a href="http://www.google.com/mac">http://www.google.com/mac</a>. For quite some time now (as long as
I can remember), this page was simply setup with a iMac insipired Google logo
and search engine that searched Mac-related web pages and sites. Now it sports
a newly inspired Google logo with mac-esqe like styling and also links to the
6 Google software downloads for the Mac:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Notifier</li>
<li>Google Toolbar</li>
<li>Google Sketchup</li>
<li>Picasa Web Albums Uploader</li>
<li>Google Earth</li>
<li>Google Widgets (for Dashboard)</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, you will notice one interesting thing about one of the items on this
list, and that is Google Notifier. <em>Google</em> Notifier? Ah yes, not Gmail
notifier&#8230;the Mac version of this popular mini app that is also available on
the PC includes an upcoming event notififier for Google Calendar. A feature
only available to the Mac crowd.</p>

<p>I would like to applaud Google for following their missions statement strong
and true. Oh yes, and I almost forgot. Google also now has a Mac blog:
<a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/">http://googlemac.blogspot.com/</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After evaluating a problem that a teammate at work was having today with
regards to importing data from a Microsoft Access database to a Microsoft SQL
Server database, I came to the conclusion after solving that problem that
Access allows a user to do things that may not be Kosher when it comes to
proper programming.</p>

<p>I will admit, that when I first started out in dynamic web development, an
Access database is all I had access to (please mind the unintentional pun). As
most young developers, I did not have the money/knowledge/resources to develop
using a higher end database. Microsoft Access was designed for the basic user
in mind, and though it is capable of working with web applications I would not
suggest using it for an application that is larger than the scope of your
personal database needs ( i.e. DVD Catalog, Pet&#8217;s Medical history etc.).</p>

<p>The issue at hand is my teammate has been recently converting an application
within our organization to the new CLAF (Common Look and Feel). Our
organization has also been converting all of the Access databases that are
owned by its customers into SQL Server databases. With this, he was attempting
to import the old Access database to a new Sql Server 2000 database. He ended
up calling me because he was having so many problems. The application is a
time tracking application that notifies the rest of the team when people are
logged in. The original developer of the application created three columns In,
Out, and TodaysDate. The In and Out fields are TimeDate datatypes but they
only stored time data, not the date. The date of the entry was stored in
TodaysDate which was the same datatypes as In and Out. Normally I leave well
enough alone when it comes to the way people design their applications. But
the issue was that my teammate spent a lot of time trying to figure out why
the database was not transferring over. He gave me a call and I eventually
figured out that the problem was that SQL Server was trying to import the In /
Out data into the SQL Server database. In and Out only has time data and SQL
Server does not allow for only the time data to be imported. What should have
been done was that the date and time data should have been included in the In
and Out columns and not had the TodaysDate column at all. Then the developer
should have received the date information by parsing it from the In and Out
fields. This also makes more sense because in the old way, if someone logged
out the next it would break the application.</p>

<p>My point in all this ranting is that Access if at all possible should not be
used for Internet application development. If you do choose to use, make sure
you use it wisely. Again, I am not saying don&#8217;t use Access cause if you don&#8217;t
have the resources to use Microsoft SQL Server or similar solution it is a
decent solution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After much discussion on the <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/reactor%40doughughes.net/">Reactor for ColdFusion mailing list</a> about a
simple request for a snapshot build of Reactor, <a href="http://www.falkensweb.com/"> Tom Chiverton</a>, has been
generous enough to supply the resources for this. You may view the snapshot
page at the location below: <a href="http://www.falkensweb.com/reactor.html">http://www.falkensweb.com/reactor.html</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are interested in executing multiple SQL statements inside a single
cfquery block and posting them to a SQL Server database, then you are in luck.
While attempting to create an install file for an application I am working on
for work, I went into Sql Server Enterprise Manager to have it create the SQL
for creating the various tables that my application needs. After copying the
code directly from the file that Enterprise Manager created and copying it
into my cfquery block, the page failed to execute.</p>

<p>Much searching produced no results on why this was happening. What I finally
figured out by process of elimination is that you cannot use the GO keyword
that SQL Server uses in its SQL statements to combine multiple statements,
instead, simply replace all GO keywords with a semi-colon at the end of each
of your statements and you will be good to go.</p>
