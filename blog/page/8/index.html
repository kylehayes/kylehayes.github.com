  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/OpenID_logo.svg/250px-OpenID_logo.svg.png" alt="" />I originally heard about OpenID around 6-8 months ago or so and
immediately went to <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/">myopenid.com</a> to secure my domain. After signing up
and being anxious to try out the new &#8220;single-sign on process&#8221; I perused the
<a href="https://www.myopenid.com/directory">list of sites that use the OpenID standard</a>. The process was interesting.
It&#8217;s not as cut and dry as one would hope, but it isn&#8217;t bad. The issue is that
some sites still require additional profile information that may not be
included in your OpenID account. Additionally, it is strange to me that your
&#8220;username&#8221; is a URL as opposed to an email address, which are also globally
unique.</p>

<p>The experience was less than exciting and I didn&#8217;t see a huge benefit of it at
the time in the manner that it was implemented.</p>

<p>Since then, I have come a cross a few sites that I actually use that have
added OpenID integration. Only one of those have I actually linked my OpenID
account: Plaxo. As for the others, I just didn&#8217;t care enough to do so.</p>

<p>As of recent, I have noticed a few large big adopters to the OpenID standard,
namely, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a>. With a large brand name like <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/openid/">Yahoo! supporting the
OpenID standard</a>, I can see the benefit of other sites using it as a means
of providing users account access to their sites. Yahoo! enabled all 248
million registered users with OpenID accounts; that is a huge user base!
Curious, I used <a href="https://www.plaxo.com/signin?t=corp">Plaxo</a> as a test case for logging in with my Yahoo!
OpenID. The process is great, simply click the &#8220;Sign-in with Yahoo! ID&#8221; button
and it redirects you to a Yahoo! OpenID page informing you the website that is
attempting to access your account and some other details. From there, you
simply click &#8220;Let me In&#8221; which will prompt Yahoo! to send Plaxo your unique
OpenID URL. This is the step that is better than using a service like
myopenid.com. With Yahoo! being an OpenID provider, you simply use your Yahoo!
Id when accessing OpenID services and Yahoo! will deal with the actual sending
of the unique OpenID URL to the requesting service. Now that my Yahoo! OpenID
account is associated, anytime I go back to Plaxo, I click sign in with Yahoo!
ID, it does a quick redirect, as mentioned above, to Yahoo! and then I click
&#8220;Let Me In&#8221; and I am immediately logged in (provided that I am already logged
in with Yahoo!, you get directed to a Yahoo! login page if you are not already
logged in). The benefit here, is that the only username and password you need
to remember, is your Yahoo! one. That&#8217;s it.</p>

<p>Another thing that should encourage developers to look into this and give
OpenID a try, is the amount of resources to help in implementation and use:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/openid/">Yahoo! OpenID</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.plaxo.com/api/openid_recipe">A Recipe for OpenID-Enabling Your Site</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gallery.yahoo.com/openid">Yahoo! Gallery of OpenID sites</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-SuperUsers">OpenID for non-SuperUsers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.openid.net/Libraries">OpenID Code Libraries</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.myopenid.com/">Popular OpenID provider (you don&#8217;t need this if you go the Yahoo! route)</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, now that I have seen where the OpenID standard is today and with some
large adopters like Yahoo! and Plaxo on-board, I think I will take another
look at this attempt to unify the web and provide people with the ultimate
single sign-on method. Standards like this are very difficult to get into the
mainstream. I was weary of OpenID taking off with it&#8217;s initial push, but today
when I saw how Yahoo! did it, I felt much better about OpenIDs continuing
success. Even so, if an average user is prompted on a registration screen to
either register with the site or use their &#8220;OpenID account&#8221;, they will
probably use the site&#8217;s registration for lack of knowledge of the benefits of
OpenID. One way that developer&#8217;s can push this revolution in a more specific
direction is to only allow access via an OpenID account. Assume users are
stupid and only give them one option to sign-in to your site.</p>

<p>I would love to hear your comments, opinions, and constructive criticism on
this topic. I think it is very relevant today and is the right time to
introduce such a standard. Also, if you have other resources to share, please
do so in the comments or send me a message.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately I have been using the Yahoo! Flex skin in a few of my interfaces as it
greatly improves the overall standard look of the Flex widgets. It&#8217;s very easy
to implement (thanks to Adobe for creating a simple workflow for this).
Recently, however, I have noticed a couple of bugs in the skin that are worth
bringing up and should definitely be fixed. Suffice it to say that I am not
sure if they are Adobe&#8217;s fault or Yahoo!&#8217;s fault.</p>

<p><img src="/share/YahooFlexSkin_bug.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see there is an issue on the bottom where a partial row of the
datagrid is showing and the other part of it is hidden. It&#8217;s the hidden part
that is causing the skin to appear invisible. Note that, as soon as I scroll
the datagrid it goes away. However, if I move my mouse over that row it comes
back. Same goes for the [+] button. You can see that it&#8217;s bounds are causing
an anomaly on the control bar.</p>

<p>Like I said, I am not sure if this is an Adobe issue or a Yahoo! issue, but it
is annoying enough that I might be swapping the skin out. I don&#8217;t want to, but
I may have to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While reading through the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/c/d/8/cd8cc719-7d5a-40d3-a802-e4057aa8c631/relnotes.htm">release notes</a> for Windows XP SP3, I was
surprised to see a heading labeled &#8220;Apple computers.&#8221; Curious, I read further
to see what it said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Apple computers</p></blockquote>

<p>This issue affects the Windows XP Home Edition and the Windows XP Professional
operating systems.</p>

<p>If you attempt to install this release candidate on an Intel-based Apple
computer (Mac Pro, Mac Mini, MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, or iMac) that
is running Windows XP SP2, installation may fail with the error &#8220;Out of disk
space.&#8221;</p>

<p>To avoid this, manually create a necessary registry key as follows: To create
the registry key</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li><p>Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK.</p></li>
<li><p>Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup</p></li>
<li><p>On the Edit menu, point to New, and click String Value.</p></li>
<li><p>In the text box under the Name column, type BootDir and press ENTER.</p></li>
<li><p>Right-click the name BootDir, and then click Modify.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Edit String Value dialog box, type the drive letter for your
system drive, and then click OK. For example, if your system drive is C:, type
C:.</p></li>
<li><p>Close Registry Editor.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>After you have created this registry key (or if you created this key when you
installed a previous version of this Service Pack), you can proceed with the
installation.</p>

<p>While this may not be terribly interesting to most people, I like it because
it shows that enough people are using Windows on their Macs for Microsoft to
test and debug it&#8217;s operating system on them (not to mention beta testers as
well probably pushing for this). Of course, we all know the real reason why
Microsoft would have Macs lying around the offices.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes there is a requirement or a desired usability enhancement for text
to be placed on the user&#8217;s clipboard. This is a great little feature in an
your application if you are able to provide it and have a good reason to. In
Flex, it couldn&#8217;t be any easier. The <em>setClipboard()</em> function lives inside
the System package. Simply call it like so: ` &#8230; import flash.system.System;
import mx.controls.Alert;</p>

<p>public function copyText(txt:String):void { System.setClipboard(txt);
Alert.show(&#8220;&#8217;&#8221; + txt + &#8220;&#8217; has been copied to your clipboard&#8221;); } &#8230; `</p>

<p>Simple as that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been working on a new Flex application at work lately which I am pretty
excited about. Not only has it received a lot of positive attention, but I
also get to learn how to build a Flex application that is to be using a PHP
middle-tier. Luckily for me, I do have experience with PHP, plus there seems
to be <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex_php.html">some great resources</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>Anyway, the application is being programmed with the help of the Cairngorm
micro-architecture and as such, there is a lot of copying and pasting of files
as I create new commands, events, and delegates. One thing that has bugged me
in the past about doing this, is figuring out which import statements belong
in the newly created class and which don&#8217;t. Many a times, I just didn&#8217;t even
bother. That has now changed, now that I discovered an easy, automagic way of
doing so.</p>

<p>Knowing that Eclipse always has some gems hidden in the right-click context
menus, I perused them to see if there was anything about import statements.
<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lo+and+behold">Lo and behold</a>, if you right-click on any of the lines that contain import
statements, and go to the submenu &#8220;Source&#8221;, there is an option called
&#8220;Organize Imports&#8221; (Or my preference: [Mac] Command + Shift + O, [PC] Ctrl +
Shift + O). Not only does it actually organize your import statements by
package alphabetically (starting with the root package), but it also
eliminates any import statements that you do not need in that class. Pretty
neat!</p>

<p>Some features I would like to see added to this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add statements that are required</li>
<li>Combine multiple import statements from the target package using wildcard (*) (Perhaps it could be defined in preferences, how many should be considered before it combines)</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many of you may have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/18/AR2008011801335.html">heard about Time Warner&#8217;s recent decision</a> to start
capping Internet bandwidth usage for it&#8217;s &#8220;customers&#8221; and charging overage
fees for usage beyond the cap.</p>

<p>While I can understand, from a business perspective, why a greedy corporation
would do such a thing, besides customer satisfaction, this move will do a lot
more than damage their popularity with their customers&#8211;they could potentially
be responsible for reversing the Information revolution as we know it.</p>

<p>When larger cable companies such as Time Warner create a market to charge for
bandwidth usage on their network because of inevitable congestion that exists
when stuffing a copper wire, other cable companies will likely hop on this
bandwagon to source their dying profits. As customers of these companies are
encouraged to use their Internet less, the market for Internet-enabled devices
begins to shrink.</p>

<p>When markets begin to shrink, the demand for research and development of new
products and technologies begins to run dry. Companies like Apple, will not be
able to push our us into a disc-less world where movies will be able to be
rented and purchased with instant gratification at the push of the button. We
will be stuck in attempting to find the next media that will hold our 100GB
ultra high-def movies and interactive features.</p>

<p>While this scenario may seem somewhat unlikely, it really is not when you
think about it. If anything, cable companies need to be nice to their
customers as the rise of fiber optic enabled Internet/Phone/TV begin to win
homeowners hearts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am struggling with a particular concept in Cairngorm. I don&#8217;t understand why
it is considered best practice that your custom cairngorm events and commands
are to have a one-to-one ratio. Flex itself is not even modeled this way. For
example, when a button is clicked, you don&#8217;t listen for a class called
ButtonClickEvent. Instead, you listen for the ButtonEvent.CLICK or
ButtonEvent.DOWN or whatever the case is. In Cairngorm, how come you cannot do
the same thing and list multiple event types in your event classes.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting to put all your types in one event class. But let&#8217;s say
you have a UserEvent. You could call UserEvent.ADD_USER,
UserEvent.DELETE_USER, UserEvent.LOGIN_USER, etc. That is all in one class
instead of having three separate classes. Can someone please explain to me the
reasoning for the one-to-one ratio please?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As many of you know, I was very fortunate to finish college and immediately
have a ColdFusion development position waiting for me at The Boeing Company.
Additionally, I had the opportunity to work on many large and great projects
from consisting of ColdFusion as well as Flex.</p>

<p>Thank you to all my co-workers at Boeing as well as my managers who saw my
potential. I would like to make a special thank you to my latest manager, Bill
Roberts, for truly understanding me as a developer and my passion for
technology. I appreciate everything that you did for me while I was at the
company.</p>

<p>From one great company to another I shall go. I was offered a web development
position with the Walt Disney Internet Group in North Hollywood. I will be
working alongside a team of developers on the Disney family network of sites:
<a href="http://www.family.com">family.com</a>, <a href="http://www.familyfun.com">familyfun.com</a>, <a href="http://www.wondertime.com">wondertime.com</a> (e.g. for more
information check out <a href="http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/broadband_factsheet.html">Disney Online Fact Sheet</a>).</p>

<p>My last day with Boeing is Thursday the 17th. My first day with Disney is
Tuesday the 22nd.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of us who participated in the MacHeist software bundle last year and
saved a ton of money on a bundle of really incredible software applications, I
am happy to tell you that it is here again and the bundle is just as good.</p>

<p>The ten great applications that are on the list this year are:</p>

<p>1password $29.95 CoverSutra $22.00 Cha-Ching $40.00 iStopMotion $49.00 Awaken
$12.95 TaskPaper $18.95 AppZapper $12.95 CSSEdit $29.95 Snapz Pro X $69.00
Pixelmator $59.00</p>

<p>As you can see those are valued at $343.75!! You can purchased the bundle for
only $49. Also, 25% of your purchase will be donated to the charity of your
choice (from their list). Just like last year, the last three applications
won&#8217;t be available in the bundles unless the program reaches a certain amount
of purchases. However, last year that was not an issue and we received all the
software as promised.</p>

<p>Once you purchase the bundle the serial numbers are immediately generated for
your enjoyment. Now, go buy that bundle so I can get my CSSEdit!!!! :-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A very common practice in Java when you want to persist or save the current
state of your application to a physical file is known as serialization or
serializing an object. What this basically means is that you are taking the
machine code that represents an object in your application, and converting it
to a format that can be written to a file.</p>

<p>The benefits of serialization is that you maintain the actual instance of the
object&#8211;not just a data representation of the object. When you read the
serialized file back in to the application, it reads in as a native object to
that application.</p>

<p>Traditionally in web applications, we accommodate this need by writing entries
in a database. Even when it comes down to session information. For the most
part, this is fine, works great and I would recommend it for the majority of
use cases. However, the serialization method described above could be used as
a more efficient means to storing the state of a rich Internet application.
Such a method is possible in ActionScript to use in your Flex application.</p>

<p>The high level process is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Represent your data model as an ActionScript object</li>
<li>Serialize your data model into the same AMF format that is used to communicate with middle-tiers like ColdFusion</li>
<li>Send the raw AMF message packet to ColdFusion in a RemoteObject call, or similar</li>
<li>ColdFusion writes the message packet to a local file on the server</li>
</ol>


<p>Naturally, you would create this functionality in a series of classes and
CFCs. In ActionScript, you will be using the Flash ByteArray class. This class
converts any ActionScript object into a ByteArray which is basically
serializing the object.</p>

<p><code>var bytes:ByteArray = new ByteArray(); bytes.writeObject(myDataModel);</code></p>

<p>From this point, <strong>bytes</strong> can now be sent to ColdFusion to be written to a
file. If you are using ColdFusion, you will want your service function to be
expecting an arguments of type=&#8221;Binary&#8221;. From there, ColdFusion can encode the
Binary into a writable format like Base64. You migh have a function that looks
something like the following:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>It is really that easy. Once you call the save function you will notice that
file now exists on the server. If you were to open it, it would just be a
series of what appears to be random data.</p>

<p>To read that data back into a usable object in Flex, you will need to setup a
service call to ColdFusion to return the binary data from the file.</p>

<p>On the ColdFusion side, the code would look something like this: `</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>And your ActionScript RemoteObject handler would probably have the following:
<code>private function myRO_handler(event:ResultEvent):void { var
myDataModel:Object = ByteArray(event.result).readObject(); }</code></p>

<p>Obviously, the above code is very procedural still since the functionality is
not encapsulated within well-defined functions. It is only meant to serve as a
basis for understanding the concept. For your convenience, and quite frankly
for mine as well, I have created an ActionScript class as well as a set of
ColdFusion components to encapsulate all this functionality. You may download
the files below.</p>
