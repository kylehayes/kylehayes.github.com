  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple made many changes with the release of XCode 3 and Interface Builder 3
with the OS X Leopard operating system for the Mac. The workflow for these
toolsets is very good as to be expected. With the release of these latest
versions they aimed to provide an even more strict bound toolset to the ideals
of the MVC paradigm.</p>

<p>In previous versions of Interface Builder, whilst creating your views for your
application, you could quickly create a subclass of an existing object, say
NSObject, by clicking the &#8220;Classes&#8221; tab and Control-clicking a class to
subclass it into your own custom class. Apple realized this was probably not
the best form as it allowed you to basically be creating part of the model
within the wrong part of the IDE. The model should be created within XCode
itself where all the other classes are developed. In Interface Builder 3, you
can no longer subclass. You need to go back to XCode and create your class
there, then when you go into Interface Builder, drag a generic
Object/ObjectController and drop it in your nib. From there, inside the
Inspector under Name, start typing the name of the custom class you created in
XCode and push return after it has auto-completed. This will in turn apply the
parent class to your custom class.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of months ago when I started my job at Disney and my commute changed
to a little over an hour at 100 miles a day, I realized that I needed to sell
my Jeep to decrease the cost in how much I was spending on fuel every month
and purchase a <a href="http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/">Toyota Prius</a>. At least, that was the initial reason.
However, since that purchase, I&#8217;ve become ever more aware of the carbon
footprint my family has on Earth.</p>

<p>I have always been somewhat interested in making that step towards a greener
life but have never really made an effort. Purchasing my Prius has encouraged
me to continue to evaluate my life and see where I can make small changes here
and there.</p>

<p>After looking through National Geographic&#8217;s<a href="http://www.thegreenguide.com/">The Green Guide</a>, I learned
that we can make a difference even with small and simple changes. You
certainly don&#8217;t need to sell your car to be more green. Little changes here
and there will better the life around you.</p>

<p>About a year ago, my wife and I replaced has many light bulbs around the home
as we could with CFLs to not only save money by not having to replace our
bulbs as often, but to also save money in electricity usage throughout the
year.</p>

<p>According to a recent report, citizens of Southern California drink the most
<a href="http://www.radicalcongruency.com/20070503-earth-day-follow-up-water-has-a-carbon-footprint">bottled water</a> in the nation. Many of us have gotten used to this luxury
and think that tap water is absolutely horrid and disgusting. Yet won&#8217;t people
don&#8217;t realize is how bad that plastic bottle is for our environment. My wife
and I are guilty of drinking lots of bottled water as we don&#8217;t have a tap in
our refrigerator. We would buy three cases of Kirkland Signature bottled water
from Costco about once a month (I think each case may have had 35 bottles or
so). With that I decided that was one of the changes I wanted to make to
reduce the amount of plastic waste I was generating. I have completely stopped
drinking bottled water altogether now and only drink tap water. When I am at
work, I fill up my durable plastic drinking bottle with the Arrowhead water
they provide us that is delivered in the large bottles that Arrowhead reuses.
This change is small and tap water doesn&#8217;t taste as bad once you have
acclimated to it. In fact, I actually prefer it now. I was not able to
convince my wife to completely switch over to tap, but she has switched over
to <a href="http://www.arrowheadwater.com/DoingOurPart/EcoShapeBottle.aspx">Arrowhead bottled water as they now use 30% less plastic</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who tends to print out content from the computer more than I really
need to, another change that I am testing out is using recycled printer paper
in my laser printer. The first ream I am testing is <a href="http://shopping.msn.com/track/TrackItemClick.aspx?p=2607:2607:841480113:S:7009:8520:-1:3:66:8520:452:5:100:-1:1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fad.doubleclick.net%2fclk%3b127424757%3b18605821%3bj%3fhttp%3a%2f%2fwww.staples.com%2fwebapp%2fwcs%2fstores%2fservlet%2fStaplesProductDisplay%3f%26storeId%3d10001%26langId%3d-1%26catalogId%3d10051%26partNumber%3d620014%26cm_mmc%3dMSNShopping-_-Shopping-_-Office_Supplies%3ePaper-_-620014-87025-CT%26ci_src%3d9686437%26ci_sku%3d620014&amp;stext=Recycled&amp;hsv=5How6SnpcqY%3d">Staples brand 100%
recycled paper</a>. It is thinner than I would like my paper to be. After this
ream is up, I may switch to 30% or find a different brand to try out.</p>

<p>Overall, I have attempted to take a second look of what I use in everyday life
to see how I can improve my green factor. I hope that you will see how easy it
is to make simple changes in your everyday life and encourage others to do the
same.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started a project a couple of months ago that has and is going to
continually have a very complex and growing architecture. The technology stack
in place is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/flex">Flex 3</a>, <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Cairngorm">Cairngorm 2.2</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/coldfusion">ColdFusion 8</a>,
<a href="http://coldspringframework.org/">ColdSpring</a>, <a href="http://www.transfer-orm.com/">Transfer</a>, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.mspx">SQL Server 2005</a>. This is my first
Flex application that will be using Transfer to handle the database
abstraction layer. Normally, I would use Brian Rinadi&#8217;s Illudium PU-36
CFCGenerator to handle the initial generation of all my CFCs and from there
would either modify the XSLT files or simply append to the generated CFCs as I
saw fit.</p>

<p>The problem with this type of approach lies namely in the early stages of
application design and development (especially since I traditionally don&#8217;t go
through a line of specs working on a solo project) when the database is going
through many changes. Each time you make a change to the database, you either
have to regenerate your files which will overwrite any changes you made, or
you have to manually hand-code the database changes. On top of this, it
doesn&#8217;t take care of any of your table relationships as per a 3rd normal form
database structure. You then have to design your own home-brew setup of such a
system if you require it, or simply provide functions that return the
structs/VOs to Flex as you need them by manually building up the hierarchical
tree of the model.</p>

<p>For this project, I knew from the beginning that the database schema was going
to be pretty complex and that it was also going to be going through changes as
I developed and tried things out. I knew that I wanted to get Transfer to work
with Flex. I had tried this once in the past and failed because I was
designing Flex applications differently at that time. I now know better to
design with a service layer in mind.</p>

<p>Although, it is not that easy either. There are actually quite a few steps
involved when using Transfer to interact with your database and to return the
right kind of objects back to Flex. Also, let me state, that I am talking
about this in terms of using the AMF protocol with RemoteObjects between
ColdFusion and Flex so that datatypes are appropriately and quickly
translated.</p>

<p>This post will first introduce the Transfer ORM framework and why it is not a
basic task to integrate it into your ColdFusion / Flex application. In the
next part of this article, I will discuss the technical details of getting
this all to work.</p>

<h3>Transfer ORM framework</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.transfer-orm.com/">Visit project website</a></p>

<p>ORM, or Object-Relational Mapping, in simplistic terms is abstracting a
representation of your data inside a database as objects in your application.
An ORM framework does all of this abstraction semi-automatically by means of
introspection to your database and generating the necessary files, or by a
configuration file that describes the datatypes and the relationships of the
tables to each other. Transfer falls into the latter category.</p>

<p>While some say that a fault of Transfer (esp when compared to a competing
framework, <a href="http://trac.reactorframework.com/">Reactor</a>) is that you have to write the table structure and
it&#8217;s relationships manually in an XML file. Whereas Reactor is a framework
that reads the database metadata. At first, I thought this same thing and
after working with Transfer later, have found it much better to be in control
and to define the relationships myself. With this method I really feel like I
have a much better understanding of what Transfer is creating when it
generates it&#8217;s objects. Plus when debugging your code it is easier to see what
columns/fields are causing issues in your relationships.</p>

<p>The benefits of using Transfer over generating the CFCs yourself using tools
like <a href="http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/">Brian Rinaldi&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cfcgenerator/">Illudium PU-36 CFCGenerator</a> is that once you
have defined your XML file, the actual creation of the CFCs is completely
automatic. To give you an example, let&#8217;s say you have a table in your database
called Employee that has the following fields: employeeId, firstName,
lastName, email. Once you have instantiated the TransferFactory, you simply
call the object the you would any other VO, only you haven&#8217;t previously
written it:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>Transfer.get() retrieves a specific Transfer object (which is defined in your
Transfer XML) with a Primary Key ID of &#8220;1&#8221;. Then it simply calls the generated
&#8220;getFirstName()&#8221; method on that object and returns it to you. That&#8217;s it! It is
really simple.</p>

<p>This is hardly even skimming the surface of what Transfer does for you. Let&#8217;s
say that an employee can have multiple phone numbers on file that you store in
a separate table called EmployeePhone. This is of course a One-to-Many
relationship. Once you have simply defined this relationship in your Transfer
XML you would then access the phone numbers this way:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>From there you can simply loop through that array which in turn provides
different EmployeePhone Transfer objects. You can configure in your XML
whether that relationship will return an array or query. Notice that I
mentioned it would return an array of <strong><em>Transfer Objects</em></strong>. This is where it
gets tricky. The default return type of any relational object is typed as a
Transfer Object. This is instantiated from the generic Transfer Object
interface in the framework and is what all the relational object inherit from.
However, you can change this by applying a decorator to any of your objects
which will change the type of the object to the decorator path. The decorator
will also allow you to add methods as well as change existing ones that the
Transfer Object defines.</p>

<p>As you can see, Transfer can be very very powerful in your applications. It
doesn&#8217;t require very much setup time and configuration. As with most advanced
concepts like this, it takes practice to really understand the underlying
methodologies and to use them wisely in your application. Also, do not think
that Transfer is simply a glorified code generator. Mark Mandel has spent a
lot of time utilizing ColdFusion&#8217;s unique strengths to truly make this a fast
and effecient framework to keep your application at top speed.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it for now. Next time I will actually get more technical about the
configuration file and start discussing how to prepare your CFC middle-tier
for Flex consumption.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve taken it upon myself (as it is my own duty to do so) to better manage my
development projects. This is a good idea for a variety of reasons, but namely
it will help keep me sane as I track each project.</p>

<p>The first thing that I wanted to accomplish is to version control my code.
Lately, I have been doing it on my local development machine. While fine for
basic versioning, it is not a good idea as a backup solution. Before when I
was only working on projects that were not bringing in any consistent income I
was trying to look for a free solution. There are actually quite a few
stripped down free hosted solutions out there.</p>

<p>However, I needed something more as my project base is growing. Naturally, I
did a Google search and found a <a href="http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/?p=1270">few</a> <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/servers/hosted_subversion/">posts</a> of others who were in the
same boat as I. After going through the list of comments on both posts, I
decided to try out the one on <a href="http://snook.ca">Snook.ca</a> a try near the bottom. The
solution is a service known as <a href="http://www.springloops.com">Springloops</a>. It sounded quite intriguing
as the description mentioned not only Subversion but also remote server
deployment.</p>

<p>The latter was a huge plus for me as I was recent talking to a friend of mine
how I wanted to build a ColdFusion app that developers could use to schedule
pushes of their code to their various servers. Alas, this solves my own
personal issue.</p>

<p>Springloops has a <a href="http://www.springloops.com/signup/">variety of plans</a> to meet your needs. After browsing
through their offerings I decided to give their 31-day trial of the Flowerpot
plan a try.</p>

<p>Sign-up was a breeze and very friendly. After receiving an email of my account
info, I logged in and began setting up two projects I am working on right now.
I am really liking the interface&#8211;everything is very easy to use and there is
also plenty of help available if you need it. As I mentioned, Springloops is
not only a Subversion host but they also give you the option to deploy a
version to a set of servers that you have defined for a given project. In my
plan, they allow me to define three servers for each project (traditionally
these would be a development, staging, and production server). Alas, I only
have a need for the latter two as my &#8220;development&#8221; server is actually my local
box. I use staging to allow clients to preview the work before it goes live.</p>

<p>When setting up a project&#8217;s SVN repo, you can choose to import a pre-existing
repository with all of its history in tact. A very nice option for those who
need it.</p>

<p>Overall, I have been very happy with Springloops. Only time will tell if I
will stay with them, but for now they are exactly what I am looking for. I
will keep you updated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.box.net/shared/static/vnxao4syss.jpg" alt="" />Unlike what I did with the pre-release of IE 7, I <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/Install.htm">downloaded IE 8 Beta
1</a> today to give it a swing.</p>

<p>Upon first start up, everything seems pretty much like IE 7 (good, I am glad
Microsoft did the consistency thing this time). There is also a new button
that allows the browser to &#8220;Emulate IE7&#8221;.</p>

<p>When you first start up the browser (after you have restarted your computer),
it walks you through a little setup wizard thing to get stuff like your search
engines, and activity searches setup etc.</p>

<p>Afterwards it takes you to the actual Microsoft.com pages to set that stuff
up. Right away I wanted to add Google, so I click on the Google search link to
add it to my browser&#8230;nothing. Clicked it again&#8230;.nothing. I decided to try
their manual process of setting up a new search engine and received the
following message:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.box.net/shared/static/i0mppwesc0.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Heh, well I&#8217;m confused as to what browser I&#8217;ve been using then!</p>

<p>Anyway, I installed it, so I will give it a try here and there and I might
report back progress.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Web Standards Project announced today the release of the Acid3 test, a
consecutive release of a series of tests designed to help browser makers
realize the standards of the web to which they are encouraged to uphold for
the best and most consistent user experience.</p>

<p>The test consists of varying amounts of CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and tests with
PNG images. Browsers are ranked on a point score based on how each one
graphically renders the different use cases.</p>

<p>The overall results for each browser are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firefox 2.0.0.12: 50%</li>
<li>Firefox 3.0b3: 61%</li>
<li>Opera 9.26: 46%</li>
<li>Safari 3.0.4: 39%</li>
<li>WebKit Nightly: 87%</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dominos.com now the stick to which all future online pizza ordering systems
(and other ordering systems) will be measured. The wife and I received a
coupon for Domino&#8217;s Pizza today in the mail, and while I normally don&#8217;t go for
eating out on a Monday night, she has been busy as of late and I had just
gotten home after sitting for quite some time in traffic. I was just going to
call in the order but then I decided to order online.</p>

<p>First of all, I immediately realized when I approached their page that they
have the &#8220;You got 30 minutes&#8221; marketing campaign right now. Also, I must say
that they have the nicest online pizza ordering site in the industry (though I
can only compare it to Papa John&#8217;s and Pizza Hut). There Web 2.0 look and feel
as well as Flash-y elements created great appeal and very nice appearance. But
that wasn&#8217;t the half of it&#8230;</p>

<p>Along with their launch of this new campaign came the launch of the &#8220;Pizza
Tracker&#8221;. This thing is awesome! A real-time application written in Flash
provide a slick interface and virtual viewport of your pizza each step of the
way. A large progress bar shows you the status from Order Placed, Prep, Bake,
Box, to Delivery all as it happens. In some of the steps, it even tells you
who completed that part of the process. It includes a glowing red filler for
each of the progress as the bar fills up. This application is a great example
of what non-technical companies can do to utilize today&#8217;s instant
gratification technologies like Flash and Data Services.</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots of the process as it was happening:</p>
