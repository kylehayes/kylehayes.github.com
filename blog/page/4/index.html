  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone is familiar with the clear stiff plastic clamshell packaging that
beautifully wraps that new computer mouse, kitchen knife, toy car.  Parents
know all too well what awaits them in order to free their child&#8217;s toy from its
casing. They are confronted with stiff plastic-coated wire ties strongly
securing the toy set to the cardboard packaging, followed by a suggestion to
use a coin to unwind a plastic lock.</p>

current frustrations of modern product packaging and how Amazon.com is working
with many companies such as Fisher-Price, Mattel, and Microsoft, to
revolutionize the packaging industry in creating easier to open, recyclable
boxes to make customers happy while respecting the environment.</p>

<p>Respect is due to companies who listen to their customers and work diligently
to change their processes to better the purchasing experience for the buyer.
In addition, if they can better the environment while they are at it, all the
better.</p>

<p>Initially, Amazon.com will be offering it&#8217;s trademarked Frustration-Free

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is a common fact that fluorescent light bulbs conserve a considerable
amount of energy in comparison to incandescent light bulbs. Until a few years
ago, these types of bulbs were limited to the long tubes you traditionally see
in commercial and industrial applications. Then the CFL was invented allowing
these highly energy efficient light sources be used in lieu of incandescents
in conventional situations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the popularity of the CFL didn&#8217;t really take off as quickly as
the energy providers had hoped. Fluorescent lighting tends to be a harsher
light and may be fine for those large warehouses and office buildings. When it
comes to a home, however, these harsh lighting conditions are undesirable to
use in the home, where warmer and softer lighting conditions are more
welcoming. In addition, when CFLs first came out, they were quite a bit more
expensive then traditional light bulbs.</p>

<p>All of this has changed over the years as the technology of the CFL has
improved dramatically. I personally have been on a constant search for that
perfect incandescent replacement to lower my energy usage and also gain longer
life of my light bulbs. Still yet, every time I drop by the store to find a
new CFL that claims to have the same &#8220;Soft White&#8221; color temperature that
incandescents are known for, I am disappointed by it&#8217;s strong yellow and green
tint that it emits into the rooms of my house.</p>

<p>About a week ago, I noticed that the GE brand was selling a new kind of CFL
that claimed to be a &#8220;Daylight&#8221; color temperature (6500K versus 3000K). I
rushed home and screwed it into my torche lamp to only be stunned by the
ultra-bright blue &#8220;daylight&#8221; glow of the lamp. There is no doubt this was the
daylight temperature they were shooting for, but what I don&#8217;t realize (and
likely others) that is actually not what you want in your room at night or
when you need light. From outside, it appeared as though I was performing
surgery or conducting science experiments from the amount of output it
produced.</p>

<p>My search continues to find the best CFL out there that provides me with the
light that I am looking for. With that, I have decided to inform my readers
with the information and research I come up with. Please note, however, that I
am not conducting any of these tests with the utmost accuracy and that my
observations are simply that.</p>

<p>I read in Consumer Reports that Wal-Mart has the largest selection of CFLs. I
purchased two brands today: GE, and Sylvania. These are the largest brand name
choices in the CFL category. I will probably test the off-brands at a later
date and post my findings.</p>

<p><img src="http://dl-client.getdropbox.com/u/102671/Blog/fluorescent/GE%20Energy%20Smart%20Packaging.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://dl-client.getdropbox.com/u/102671/Blog/fluorescent/Sylvania%20Micro-Mini%20Packaging.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I was not able to find two packs that contained the same number of bulbs
between the two brands. The GE I purchased came with 3 bulbs, and the Sylvania
came with 2.</p>

<p>I provided a chart below that contains all the relevant details of these two
bulbs. My brief observations are as follows. The GE is cheaper than the
Sylvania (which is probably due to the 3-pack versus the 2-pack), however,
sometimes you get what you pay for. The first thing you may notice when
comparing the two packages, is that the Sylvania lasts for 11 years, where the
GE only lasts for 6 years. If you read the fine print, you will see that is
not an even comparison. GE is making that claim of using the bulbs for 4 hours
a day, whereas Sylvania is making that claim when using the bulb for only 3
hours a day. When you make the adjustment for the GE bulb, it turns out to be
just shy of 11 years as well. Another way to compare is the number of hours
that each last, which is printed on the box as well.</p>

<p><img src="http://dl-client.getdropbox.com/u/102671/Blog/fluorescent/Sylvania%20Micro%20Mini.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Sylvania bulb was the one that I tested first. After the initial warm up
time (which only occurs when the bulb is cold) I immediately was thrilled by
the kind of light it was producing. It had a very warm yet bright white light,
just like an incandescent.</p>

<p><img src="http://dl-client.getdropbox.com/u/102671/Blog/fluorescent/GE%20Energy%20Smart.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As for the GE, I was not as impressed. It looked the same as all the other
CFLs that I have purchased in the past. Not nearly as bright, yellowish green
tint, and took a long time (over a minute) to warm-up. Another nice feature of
the Sylvania is it&#8217;s ability to instantly turn on, without having to wait for
a flicker start-up that fluorescents are accustomed to.</p>

<p><img src="http://dl-client.getdropbox.com/u/102671/Blog/fluorescent/Bulbs-Side-by-Side.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally, I also like the Sylvania bulb&#8217;s design better than the GE. It was a
little bit smaller, the spirals were more compact, and a nice base.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google announced today its latest project, Google Chrome, a competitor in the
browser market. Here are some of the high-level points to know about Chrome:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses multi-threaded processes to isolate page executions, allowing for better performance and quicker, more reliable memory freeing</li>
<li>Built off the WebKit code base (used by Safari, Adobe AIR, Nokia, iPhone, Android mobile platform [Google&#8217;s mobile OS) due to its impressive speed</li>
<li><p>Faster and rebuilt JavaScript virtual machine called V8 (Virtual machines provide safety and platform independence)</p>

<ul>
<li>In V8, as execution goes on, objects that end up with the same properties will share the same hidden class</li>
<li>In Chrome, JavaScript is not interpreted, it is compiled to machine code for faster execution in the browser</li>
<li>Precise garbage collection</li>
<li>V8 is independent of the browser so other projects can use the engine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Better URL bar interaction design</p>

<ul>
<li>URL box (coined Omnibox) is a apart of each tab (rather than the browser window)</li>
<li>Omnibox not only handles urls, but also suggestions for searches, top visited pages, and popular pages you haven&#8217;t visited</li>
<li>Full text search for your historical pages</li>
<li>Smarter URL completion</li>
<li>Searching sites like Amazon or Wikipedia, captures their search boxes on your local system, allowing you to search those sites later on straight from your URL bar</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>New &#8220;home page&#8221; when opening a new tab displaying your nine most visited pages and the sites you search on</p></li>
<li>Incognito window for private browsing</li>
<li>Pop-ups are scoped to the tab they came from and confined there. If you do want a popup to occur, just drag out a graphical area to open it&#8217;s own window</li>
<li>Webapps can launch their own browser window with a minified chrome without the URL box and the browser toolbar</li>
<li><p>Sandboxing to keep page processes from being able to write files to your hard drive or read files from sensitive areas on your computer</p>

<ul>
<li>User must initiate actions requested to run by the browser</li>
<li>With one exception, plugins, can run at higher levels than the browser itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Plugins are now run in their own process</p>

<ul>
<li>The rest of the page can still be sandboxed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Chrome continually downloads lists of harmful sites, one for phishing, one for malware, presenting the user a warning if they stumble upon either</p>

<ul>
<li>If a user visits a site with malware, Google notifies the owner of a website to let them know so they can clean up their site</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Google Gears is built in</p></li>
<li>Completely open source</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I have converted over to using Gmail&#8217;s online interface, I have
also been using Google Calendar ever so frequently. The workflow Google
invented for these products is very efficient and I enjoy using both of them.</p>

<p>While Google Calendar is great in that I can view and edit it anywhere, it&#8217;s
not so great, when I am not somewhere there is an Internet connection for my
computer, or for my iPod Touch. One way I attempted a while back in keeping
the these calendars in sync, was to use the private iCalendar address that
Google provides for my calendar. The issue I quickly found was that is a read
only link of course, I needed to be able to add events via my iPod Touch or
iCal.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon a little product known as Spanning Sync, which at the time was
in private beta. After a couple of weeks of signing up to be notified when
they were opening more beta spots, I garnered an invitation to the beta. I
have been a loyal user ever since.</p>

<p>Spanning Sync does an incredible job at syncing your Google Calendar with any
of your Mac Calendars (iCal, Entourage, etc.). It uses a centralized syncing
engine that is always being improved on that is extremely accurate and very
efficient. I have my preferences set to sync every 10 minutes. When I add an
event on Google Calendar, I can be assured that when I go home, that same even
will be sitting in the iCal database waiting for me.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t have to keep iCal open all the time either for all this to work.
iCal actually reads it&#8217;s data from a centralized user account database that is
stored on your Mac. Spanning Sync, syncs with that very database even when
iCal is closed. In addition, they give you many options for which you can
choose the calendars you would like to sync from iCal to Google Calendar.</p>

<p><a href="http://spanningsync.com/?r=6T7TYY">I highly recommend you give them a try by signing up for a 15-day trial</a>.
And, if you click through my site, you&#8217;ll save $5 on the annual subscription
(which is normally $25, which I find to be more than reasonable if it means
having my life synced up so well).</p>

<p>One final note, they are a company built off of great morals. They really
respect their user&#8217;s wishes and are very attentive to the customer support
they offer.</p>

<p>Leave comments below if you have tried them before, and what your experiences
were or are.</p>

<p>Uploaded with <a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://skitch.com">Skitch</a>!</p>

<p>In a response to Brian Rinaldi&#8217;s post <a href="http://www.remotesynthesis.com/post.cfm/good-enough-to-touch-apps-for-the-ipod-touch"><em>Good Enough to Touch? Apps for the
iPod Touch</em></a>, I&#8217;ve decided to compose my first guest post of a review of
the new Texas Hold&#8217;em game offered on the recently released <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/">App Store</a> for
iPhone and iPod Touch owners.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of the classic poker game, Texas Hold&#8217;em or Hold&#8217;em for short,
and have been for a few years now. I find it more exciting than traditional
5-card draw/stud&#8211;not to mention better odds of winning. I&#8217;m always on the
lookout for a good electronic rendition of the game. Browsing the App Store, I
found one that received extremely good reviews and for a price of $4.99, I
couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>

<p>After playing for a few minutes, I was addicted to the beautiful graphics and
in-game integrated video of live action opponents&#8211;each one dressed atypically
as a poker aficionado. The game incorporates superb touch interaction while
coupling with the unwritten style of playing Hold&#8217;em (e.g., double-tapping to
Check). When betting, a cleverly placed spinner graphic allows you to easily,
though slightly inaccurately, change your bet higher or lower.</p>

<p>Hold&#8217;em intelligently takes advantage of iPhone/iPod&#8217;s smart rotation
technology to switch screen modes. Doing so changes from a vertical upright
view of the players to a bird&#8217;s eye view of the table and each player&#8217;s
profile.</p>

<p>While the game offers the opportunity to play in various different
environments (e.g., Garage, Paris, Cruise ship, Las Vegas), they are not all
accessible upon your first play. The game is centered around the tournament
style where you must win a game starting at the Garage table to accumulate
enough money to fund your buy-in to a table in a more upscale environment. As
you accumulate enough money, the chances of winning a tournament becomes
increasingly difficult as requirements of winning multiple tables comes into
play.</p>

<p>The AI is equally impressive and more advanced for a standard off-the-shelf
electronic Hold&#8217;em in that the <em>characters</em> with whom you play each have their
own style of playing the game in how they bet and bluff.</p>

<p>Another perk that this game offers is the ability to play in a multiplayer
environment with other iPhone/iPod Touch owners within the same WiFi network.
While the odds are that you will be able to find another user who happens to
have purchased the game and who happens to be playing it on your WiFi network
are slim-to-none, it&#8217;s a great idea to encourage your friends to purchase the
game and participate in this mode.</p>

<p>Overall, I highly recommend this game for both iPhone and iPod Touch users as
it incorporates all the great features that you have come to love with these
excellent touch-enabled devices. Mutiplayer via WiFi is optional which is
great for iPod Touch owners. If you have your headphones handy, plug them in
for enjoyable music serenading a friendly game of Hold&#8217;Em.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a long time coming (and a long time since I&#8217;ve blogged); the newest
addition to the Family.com site that I , and many of co-programmers, work on
has officially been released. Months and months of research, development, and
testing should hope to prove fruitful for the continual success of Family.com.
Introducing: <a href="http://family.go.com/">Family.com Community</a>.</p>

<p>This new feature is an attempt to bring in the great social networking
benefits that the Internet offers to the moms and families that visit this
site. It&#8217;s a place where they can start groups and topics on anything related
to family and children. They will connect with other folks who are in the same
boat as they are to comfort them that they are not alone.</p>

<p>The site incorporates the latest technologies such as: Java 6, Spring,
Hibernate, DWR, AJAX, DHTML, and many other &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; features.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="http://family.go.com">Family.com</a> and click on &#8220;Community&#8221; to create your own avatar and
family. Then invite other friends and family to join as well!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Any programmer worth his salt knows that when you perform even the most
minimal validation on a set of input textboxes for a form, that you need to
wrap some kind of trim function around the string. So many times, I see
developers write the following as a validation rule:</p>

<p><code>var validate = function(foo) { if(foo=="") alert('Please provide a value for
"foo"'); }</code></p>

<p>Clearly, all the user would have to do is provide a value with either a space
or line break to make the value valid. The whole point of checking the value
to ensure it is not empty is to ensure that the user did not provide only non-
characters as well!!! The way to accomplish this type of validation would be
simply to use the common programming function known as trim. The basics is
that the function will shave off any spaces at the beginning and end of a
given string to ensure the string is not padded. In the case of value that has
only a space, this would make the string appear as completely empty.</p>

<p>Well for those attempting to accomplish the above in JavaScript will be out of
luck unless they write the function themselves. Now, simply searching for
&#8220;JavaScript trim&#8221; provide a plethora of results that will work just fine.
However, being a proponent of YUI, I prefer to use the built-in tools and
functions it offers if available. Sure enough, simply searching for YUI Trim
in Google yielded that the function does indeed exist and, of course, is quite
easy to use:</p>

<p><code>function validate(this) { if(YAHOO.lang.trim(this)=="") alert('Please
provide a value for "this"); }</code> `</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My wife and I are finally at the end of escrow on our home in Chino Hills,
California. We should be closing any day now. We&#8217;ve been extremely busy
packing, signing, and worrying about getting stuff done. As we actually make
the move and get settled into our new place, I will not be able to be online
much, nor be posting anything for a little while here. Thank you to all my
faithful readers who have stuck with me this long, I promise some decent
content upon my return.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
