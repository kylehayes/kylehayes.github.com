  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just arrived into the Phoenix International Airport. I have a connecting
flight from here into Washington DC Reagan. As I was walking towards the gate
that I was to depart from, I noticed that many people had their laptops out.
My thought was that either this town was highly technical, or that there was
free WiFi :-)</p>

<p>The latter proved true when I opened up my MacBook and began surfing right
away. Good job Phoenix! Maybe you can chat with John Wayne Waiport and LAX to
get them to do the same.</p>

<p>Flight at 12:13pm PST towards Washington.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.jellyfish.com/images/jellyfish_we_share_blue.gif" alt="" />Early this morning I quickly whipped up an Apollo application that
conveniently shows the <a href="http://www.jellyfish.com/?jfp=3AhSCFdvfnfBfpPNGSnWPbwXJyGVxRyziKYnrlMg7oE=">Jellyfish.com</a> SmackTV show. I have also added a
single feature that allows you to compact the window to only show the
countdown of the current product and not see the chat (great for when you have
many windows open and still want to keep your eye on the continuously dropping
price). Download the AIR file by clicking the download link below.</p>

<p>For those of you not familiar with <a href="http://www.jellyfish.com/?jfp=3AhSCFdvfnfBfpPNGSnWPbwXJyGVxRyziKYnrlMg7oE=">Jellyfish.com</a>, it is a relatively new
Web 2.0&#8217;esqe shopping and price comparison site. However, unlike other price
comparison websites, Jellyfish actually kicks back about half of their
referral bonus to you in the form of a refund.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.jellyfish.com/smack/images/smacktv/header/smack_shopping_logo.gif" alt="" />The best part of the site is the reverse-auction style SmackTV (a
&#8216;smack&#8217; is a group of jellyfish) where a product is listed on the page
starting at the retail price from some store. Immediately it begins dropping
in price and all the users who are participating purchase the product (if they
want to) at as low of price as they can. The catch is, you don&#8217;t know how many
they have left!!! So the auction can end at any time. The amount of money
discounted comes to you in the form of refund in your Jellyfish.com account.</p>

<p>The site is completely valid and I have yet to get any junk mail from them or
anything. I myself have made purchases not only through the store but through
SmackTV and have received valid checks and to this date totaling $258.96!!!</p>

<p>It really is a very cool site so <a href="http://www.jellyfish.com/?jfp=3AhSCFdvfnfBfpPNGSnWPbwXJyGVxRyziKYnrlMg7oE=">check it out</a>!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BVAH8WJ6L._AA240_.jpg" alt="" />For those of you that didn&#8217;t hear, <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> announced the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30itunesplus.html">iTunes
Plus</a> section of the iTunes music store. In addition to this announcement,
Apple also announced the availability of <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30appletv.html">YouTube on the AppleTV</a> as well
as the <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30itunesu.html">launch of the iTunes U</a>, a new part of the iTunes store that offers
free educational lectures from some of the best institutions in the world.</p>

<p>DRM Free music is now officially available on iTunes Plus for only 30 cents
more per track which also gives you a higher quality song (256 kbps AAC) and
no DRM protection! For those of you that don&#8217;t know exactly what that means,
that means you can now play and burn that song on whatever the heck you want
and that it is not limited to iPods and iTunes any longer.</p>

<p>My first iTunes Plus purchase is Jeremy Camp&#8217;s latest album, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=201053345&amp;s=143441">Beyond

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been working on a Flex project for quite a few months now that is
finally scheduled to go into production in the next week or so. However, there
were a few features that the customer wanted me to add before we went into
production.</p>

<p>First off let me say that this project is basically an employee relationship
application that quickly shows how one employee is related in the corporate
tree structure to their manager and everyone else above them. The application
is also used as a lookup directory to find people within the company.</p>

<p>With that, the customer wanted the ability to see the user node in the tree
selected after a search result was clicked in the datagrid. Keep in mind that
the data for the tree is being pulled dynamically from a database and then
appended to the appropriate node in the tree.</p>

<p>This didn&#8217;t sound too hard, until I racked my brain for two weeks trying to
figure it out!! Turns out, it is not as easy as simply using some E4X to find
the node I need and telling the tree to select that object (well it is, but it
is all in the timing, according to Peter Ent).</p>

<p>Peter Ent shared with me that&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;one thing to learn about the Flex Framework is timing. Often what
properties are set on a component do not have immediate visual effect. The
Flex Framework, to keep the amount of redrawing to a minimum, will set flags
(perhaps you have seen invalidateProperties or invalidateDisplayList) to let
the framework know that the visual display will need updating.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes you&#8217;ll want to make a function call on a component right after you
set a property, but because setting the property doesn&#8217;t actually change
anything, that function call may do nothing or lead to an error. So you can
use <strong>callLater</strong> to queue up what you want to do once all of the properties
have been set.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Peter said, the <strong><a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/2/docs/00001438.html">callLater()</a></strong> function (which is not talked about in
any of my Flex books nor is it widely known) will basically queue up the
method you want to perform on a display item. This will clear up a lot of the
pesky display problems in Flex.</p>

<p>To use it simply say:</p>

<p>` public function someMethod():void { &#8230; callLater(myCoolMethod,
[anyArgsIMayNeed]); &#8230; }</p>

<p>public function myCoolMethod(arg1:Object, arg2:Object):void { &#8230;
myTree.selectedItem = arg1; &#8230; } `</p>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I apologize for yet another link and not posting something little more useful
like <a href="http://www.kylehayes.info/blog/index.cfm/2007/4/16/Captivate-Tutorial-Viewing-a-ColdFusion-Query-in-a-Flex-DataGrid">another Captivate tutorial</a> but this site is really cool.</p>

<p>The site is called <a href="http://www.apollohunter.com/">ApolloHunter.com</a> and it is a place to share the
communities applications that are built on the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo">Adobe Apollo</a> runtime. Nice
and simple design make this site worth checking out and using for inspiration
on your next big (or small) Apollo application.</p>

<p>It also features a quick link to download the runtime for Apollo as well as
small screenshots of each of the applications. It also has a DIGG button at
the top left, so let&#8217;s make this site known and continue to boost the
popularity of Apollo!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Found this link on <a href="http://www.riapedia.com">Mike Potter&#8217;s</a> blog after he posted a link to a Flex
application for <a href="http://www.riapedia.com/2007/05/28/this_flex_app_is_making_me_thirsty">ordering a pizza</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://ria.corank.com/">http://ria.corank.com/</a></p>

<p>The interface is nearly identical to that of the popular tech news site,
<a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg.com</a>. It almost seems that the developers may have even copied some
of the images and CSS that Digg uses. The popularity of the site is obvious by
the amount of &#8220;diggs&#8221;. The count is quite low. By and by, I just realized that
the site indeed is not just made for this one use, it is actually a service
called <a href="http://www.corank.com">CoRank.com</a> that allows you to create your own social bookmarking
and news site.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how well that concept does. Nonetheless, worth
checking out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>More and more &#8220;explorers&#8221; for Flex 2 are being released. They are great tools
for the developers because they get to see and experiment what the various
components or other features of the Flex programming language act like in
various ways with various variables. Then the explorer usually provides the
code for the partcular setup that set so that you can use it in your own
project.</p>

<p>Here is another helpful explorer demonstrating Flex 2&#8217;s filters:
