  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today at work, I accidentally deleted my entire local web server root due to a
ANT sync task that I had setup incorrectly.</p>

<p>I searched online for a way to recover these files since ANT doesn&#8217;t send them
to the recycle bin or anything. I quickly came across a very nice, fast, easy-
to-use file recovery application called <a href="http://www.recuva.com/download">Recova</a>. I was happy to see that
it was FREE as well.</p>

<p>I downloaded and installed it right away and began scanning. It found all the
files that ANT had deleted within a couple of minutes. I was even able to
filter on the path. Selection of the files was as easy as a single checkbox at
the top to select everything. I click the button to start to recover and was
going to choose the same disk that the files came from&#8211;it warned me this
would not be a good idea because I could possibly overwrite the deleted files.
I changed the directory to a different disk and chose to have it maintain
folder structure.</p>

<p>It worked perfectly and now I am back up and running in less than 30 minutes.
I have an ongoing backup, the issue with that is that it only occurs once a
day and so had I restored from that, I would have lost my work from part of
yesterday. This recovery was possible because the files had just been deleted.</p>

<p>Also, I would like to note that I was in Windows. Naturally, if I was on my
Mac, I would have used Time Machine :-P</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of days ago I was catching up on some articles from <a href="http://www.designmeltdown.com">Design
Meltdown</a> and came across his <a href="http://www.designmeltdown.com/chapters/Brown/Part4.aspx">recent post on sites that use a lot of
brown</a> to communicate a certain mood and feeling that is somewhat
disconnected from technology. The color tends to give the feeling of warmth,
comfort, and welcomeness.</p>

<p>As I was looking at the example sites that he posted, to my sheer surprise,
mine was one of the examples. Looking at some of the others and reading his
article inspired me to take the brown feel a step further. Yesterday I mocked
the style that I wanted my site to have in my head. This morning, I went ahead
and laid it out in Photoshop.</p>

<p>Last year when I redesigned my site, I made sure that I used proper CSS
techniques so that if I ever did want to update the look of my site, I could
do it easily. It only took me about 3 hours to do (which included the actual
designing in Photoshop). I thought that was quite good! The actual
implementation of the changes in the site maybe took about 45 minutes&#8211;which
is about 30 minutes too long. This has to do with some things that I would
have done differently to make it more effecient. No big deal.</p>

<p>I also designed the new look with in mind that I was going to keep a lot of
the same elements. The navigation bar was NOT one of them however. Yet, once I
placed the header on the page the navigation bar was just a little below the
header this time (as opposed to being a part of the header as it was before),
and I decided to keep it this way and tweak it a little.</p>

<p>Finally, everything else pretty much fell into place. I changed the colors a
little of the text and links, but for the most part everything else is the
same. It&#8217;s amazing how much just the background and the header of a page can
change the look of the whole site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good usability in an application should not be completely noticeable by the
user. It may be something that the user simply expects the application to do
based on past experience or the way that it presents itself.</p>

<p>Here is a tip on making the action of deleting items from a list more user-
friendly. In Flex, if you want the user to be able to use their &#8220;Delete&#8221; key
on their keyboard to remove items from a list, you would first have to add an
event listener to the list for the &#8220;KeyUp&#8221; (or KeyDown depending on what you
are doing) event.</p>

<p>From there you would then check the keyCode to make sure it is the one for the
Delete key. After that you simply remove the item from the collection that the
list is tied to right? Well, yes, but if you notice when you do that, the list
no longer has a selected item. Why is this bad? Many computer users interact
with lists in applications on a daily basis, one particularly popular one is a
list of emails in their favorite Mail application like Apple Mail,
Thunderbird, or Outlook. When the user selects an email in the list for
deletion, these mail programs will automatically select the next item above it
after the selected one has been deleted. They do this so that the user can
continue stroking the delete key to remove more items from the list, without
having to select more of them.</p>

<p>Since the List component in Flex does not have this functionality built in
when you hit the delete key (nor should it) you have to program it yourself.
This takes a little thinking because it is not just a matter of subtracting
one from the previous selected index. The code looks as follows: ` private
function lstItems_onKeyUp(event:KeyboardEvent):void { if(event.keyCode==46) {
deleteSelected(); } }</p>

<p>public function deleteSelected():void { var index:Number =
lstItems.selectedIndex; if(index >= 0) { acDupData.removeItemAt(index);
if(index > 0 &amp;&amp; acDupData.length >= 1) lstItems.selectedIndex = (index - 1);
else if(index == 0 &amp;&amp; acDupData.length >=1) callLater(selectFirst); } }</p>

<p>private function selectFirst():void { lstItems.selectedIndex = 0; } `</p>

<p>In the deleteSelected() function, we first store the currently selected index
of the list so that we still have a reference to it after we delete that item.
Then we actually remove the item form the dataProvider (and through the magic
of binding, it is reflected in the List component as well). Then we setup a
conditional IF statement that first checks if the previous selected index was
not the first item in the list AND we still have a list left to select from.
Then, we go ahead and subtract 1 from the previous selected index and set the
new selectedIndex to this.</p>

<p>What if the previous selected index was the first item? If we try to subtract
one from that and set the new selected index, we would get an error as that
would equal -1 and there is no such position. So, the latter part of the
conditional statement is we check if the previous index was zero and to see if
we have anything else left to select. If we do, we go ahead and set the first
item to be selected again.</p>

<p>Now you might be wondering why I couldn&#8217;t just set the list to the 0 position
and why I had to use callLater(). Read my post, <a href="http://www.kylehayes.info/blog/index.cfm/2007/5/31/callLater--The-Function-That-Saved-My-Butt">callLater() - The Function
That Saved My Butt</a>, to get more information.</p>

<p>Give this new found functionality a try below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently I am creating a somewhat series of posts about Leopard. I suppose I
could just put them all together and create one giant super post, but that is
not as fun as posting as I find them, plus this is great for categorizing.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to watch a price of a product on Amazon to see if it goes
down and snatch it up when it does? Well, there are <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=amazon+price+watch&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">some subscription
services</a> that do just that for you and send you an email update. Or,
without giving out your email address to yet another web service, why not just
web clip the product name and price and drop it in Dashboard?</p>

<p>Take a look at this screenshot:

<p>Btw, I didn&#8217;t used to be a real avid user of Dashboard&#8211;very light user
actually, but with Web Clip, I know that I will be using it a lot more often!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After just getting Leopard installed, I immediately began diving into all the
new 300+ features. While playing with the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari.html">Web Clip</a> feature with
Safari + Dashboard, I had an idea. Why couldn&#8217;t I create a web clip of Gmail
and run Gmail from my Dashboard? Practical? Not quite, but let&#8217;s see it in
action.</p>

<p>Sure enough, it works great! Full usable and everything. Here is a screenshot:

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> opened a survey to the community of those who &#8220;make
websites&#8221; across the world earlier in the year. I participated in the 37
question survey that asked a variety of things such as gender, ethnicity and
age, as well as income, profession, industry, location, among others.</p>

<p>They received such an overwhelming response that they hired a couple of
statisticians to assist in evaluating the raw data that they collected and
turn it into valuable information. The results are quite different than one
would expect in some areas. There were also some ambiguities due to how some
of the questions were worded and such.</p>

<p>Definitely worthwhile taking a look at.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Datagrids in Flex 2 are great because of how flexible they are in allowing you
to display your data pretty much however you want, while keeping the
consistent format of a grid with columns and rows.</p>

<p>Two of the features of the DataGridColumn objects in the DataGrid tag are
ItemRenderer and labelFunction. Both allow you to change how the data is
displayed to the user in the grid. Use <em>labelFunction</em> when you want to simply
format the text (i.e. a phone number, product ID). Use an itemRenderer when
you actually want to use an object of some sort in place of the label and text
that is used by default (i.e. a checkbox, or button, or a custom component
that you created).</p>

<p>Here is how you would use a labelFunction to format a phone number: `</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>Notice that I also took into a account if I had multiple phone numbers in the
object and still used a single function. You may be able to do this somewhat
dynamically but I chose not to for ease of use and understanding.</p>
