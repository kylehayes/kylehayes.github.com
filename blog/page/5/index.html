  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix, Inc</a>, the nation&#8217;s most popular online DVD rental service,
announced the first Netflix ready device in a series of more to come. <a href="http://www.netflix.com/NetflixReadyDevices?tb=how&amp;lnkctr=nfrdhow1">The
Netflix Player by Roku</a>, as they&#8217;re calling it, is availabel immediately
and will provide over 10,000 movies to Netflix subscribers instantly to their
TVs.</p>

<p>This is clearly a product that is aimed at the AppleTV which allows users to
rent and download movies from its popular iTunes Store. The immediate clear
difference between the two products is the large number of offerings (10,000
with Netflix, and less than 1000 movies from iTunes) and the cost of the two
devices. Roku is offering their device for $99 whereas the AppleTV starts at
$229. Naturally, I would be the first to agree with anyone that says you are
getting a lot more from the AppleTV than you would be from the Roku device,
such as home networking capabilities, network music and photo sharing, as well
as the Apple name, support, and design. However, I&#8217;m thrilled to see this
product as it is really the first of its kind to offer a low-cost option for
online streams of movies and TV without the need for any kind of individual
physical medium such as DVDs or Blu-Ray discs.</p>

<p>Another notable difference is that the Roku device claims the content is
&#8220;near&#8221; DVD-quality, compared to that of Apple&#8217;s soon-to-be-released HD
versions of their movies.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been telling folks and friends that I think we have seen the end of
physical format wars and that the future is online downloadable content. For
you will no longer have to rebuild your entire collection with the latest
high-quality tape/disc. This announcement from Netlfix was the next step we
needed to push our home entertainment choices into the next century more
quickly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In today&#8217;s day and age where the Internet is a part of our everyday life,
there has never been a time more appropriate now then to have really good
navigation on your or your client&#8217;s website. As sites grow more advanced and
complex, it is vital to the success of your website that users are able to
find what they need in a timely fashion without jumping through hoops to get
there.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596528108?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cf0d-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596528108">Designing Web Navigation: Optimizing the User Experience</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=cf0d-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596528108" alt="" /> helps you
lay the ground work to achieve a great user interaction experience. This full-
color O&#8217;Reilly book clearly explains the full process of designing web
navigation in three parts: Foundations of Web Navigation, A Framework for
Navigation Design, and Navigation in Special Contexts.</p>

<p>In Foundations, the author writes an adequate analysis of various types of
navigation systems, such as the search model, browse model, or the liquid
information model to name only a few. He describes why poor navigation design
will turn away users and may actually decrease the credibility of your
website. Furthermore he touches on topics such as banner blindness where your
users may not truly notice intentional site navigation, simply because back in
their minds it looks like a vertical advertisement banner.</p>

<p>In Framework, Kalbach evaluates different forms of navigation for different
types of sites. He talks about the need to engage your users to help determine
what style will work best for your target audience. Moreover, he discusses
types of technologies that may be implemented such as back-end technologies
and front-end technologies like CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>James Kalbach does an excellent job describing every facet of this complex and
sometimes daunting process in a very detailed yet easy to comprehend fashion.
He backs up all the research he has done with references as well as providing
great additional reading and other resources. The full-color diagrams and case
studies of existing navigations on real-world websites prove invaluable to the
reader. One small complaint I have is that for a book on designing navigation,
the page numbers are quite small and difficult to glance at when you are
flipping through the book. Aside from this small glitch, as it were, this book
is a must have in every web developer or designer&#8217;s library. Even if you
consider yourself to be an expert at web page flow, you cannot go without
learning a rule or two, and perhaps some great what not to dos in this book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Despite being an Adobe fanboy, I never cared much for how the Spry framework
handles things like animations. Seemed complex at the time for basic
operations. At work, they have standardized on using the YUI framework. This
has been great for me because I have always wanted to dive deeper into it and
learn about its ins and outs. With that, I needed to do some basic fade
animations for a User Interface I am working on.</p>

<p>I looked up the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/">docs for the the animation package</a>. After reading for a
few minutes, I was blown away at how the YUI developers were able to execute
such a powerful, customizable feature in a very simple way. First, you simply
create an attributes object that contains the property you want to change (in
our case it will be the opacity) and what you want to change it to:</p>

<p><code>var attributes = { opacity: {to: 0} }</code></p>

<p>Notice that a <em>from</em> attribute is not present. This is only because if <em>from</em>
is not provided, YUI will perform the animation based on the current value of
the attribute you are modifying.</p>

<p>Once you have your attributes object defined, animating your object is simple:</p>

<p><code>var myAnimObj = new YAHOO.util.Anim("myDiv", attributes);
myAnimObj.animate();</code></p>

<p>We instantiated a new Anim object by passing in a string of the id of the
element we want to animate (note: a dom element object can also be passed),
and the attributes object. Then we simply call the animate() method to play
the animation.</p>

<p>Extremely simple and straightforward. On top of this, YUI, having the
incredible event engine that it has, allows you to subscribe to events for
<em>onStart</em>, <em>onTween (which occurs on every frame)</em>, and <em>onComplete</em> providing
limitless animation effects and chaining.</p>

<p>Be sure that when you try the examples above, that you have included the
following files in your document head: `</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>Finally, you must also create an element that you actually want to apply the
animation with an id of &#8220;myDiv&#8221; for the above examples to work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="http://www.kylehayes.info/blog/index.cfm/2008/5/5/ScrollWheel-Functionality-in-Office-2007-Tabs">blogged the other day</a> about an Office 2007 feature for the tabs that
are apart of the ribbon in that you can use your scroll wheel to change the
selected tab. I thought this was actually pretty cool.</p>

<p>I decided to implement it in Flex because I figure it would be extremely
easy&#8230; and it was! Took about 15 minutes total. However, it seems it is
having issue when playing without a breakpoint in the code. Just playing
through normally, when I scroll up or down, it actually seems to skip a tab
when going through them. Yet, if I put a breakpoint at the beginning of the
event handler and play through it that way, it goes to the next tab as it
should.</p>

<p>Here is a demo of what I have done. Source is included&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Leopard upgrade to OS X changed a few things with the local web server
configuration. Namely, it comes standard with Apache2 now which means that
VirtualHosts are done differently as well now. After attempting to add my own
custom VirtualHosts to what I thought was the right conf file, I gave up and
found a better solution.</p>

<p>Patrick Gibson provides a great little shell script that I simply run with the
name of the VirtualHost that I want to create and it automatically makes all
the appropriate changes to the VirtualHosts conf file as well as the &#8220;hosts&#8221;
file. More information here:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was said that the introduction of the unified ribbon toolbar in Office 2007
would increase the productivity and efficiency of its users. With my
experience thus far, this has really yet to be the case.</p>

<p>However, today, I accidentally stumbled across and interesting feature that I
think could be wisely used in other tab controlled interfaces (e.g. modern web
browsers). While your mouse is in the boundary of any of the application
ribbons in Office 2007, if you scroll your mouse wheel, the tab index advances
(scroll up) or regresses (scroll down). It seems to be very quick and
responsive on my system.</p>

<p>I find this to be very useful for getting to content even quicker and would be
quite cool to see this in Firefox or even other applications like Photoshop
and Illustrator where tabbed content lives on.</p>

collaborate with each other, I have created a new Google Group, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/iphone-developers">iPhone
Developers</a>.</p>

<p>I have been learning this technology lately. As a newbie to both OS X
development, iPhone development, Objective-C, and the Cocoa framework, I
wanted a central place to gather help from those in this brand new community.
Seeing as Google Groups is pretty much the best place to host a message board
as it only requires a Google account, I have started this group here.</p>

<p>Please invite those you think may be interested in joining. Would love to see
Mac and iPhone developers alike join this group.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple made many changes with the release of XCode 3 and Interface Builder 3
with the OS X Leopard operating system for the Mac. The workflow for these
toolsets is very good as to be expected. With the release of these latest
versions they aimed to provide an even more strict bound toolset to the ideals
of the MVC paradigm.</p>

<p>In previous versions of Interface Builder, whilst creating your views for your
application, you could quickly create a subclass of an existing object, say
NSObject, by clicking the &#8220;Classes&#8221; tab and Control-clicking a class to
subclass it into your own custom class. Apple realized this was probably not
the best form as it allowed you to basically be creating part of the model
within the wrong part of the IDE. The model should be created within XCode
itself where all the other classes are developed. In Interface Builder 3, you
can no longer subclass. You need to go back to XCode and create your class
there, then when you go into Interface Builder, drag a generic
Object/ObjectController and drop it in your nib. From there, inside the
Inspector under Name, start typing the name of the custom class you created in
XCode and push return after it has auto-completed. This will in turn apply the
parent class to your custom class.</p>
