  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, I didn&#8217;t even expect this, but I was nominated for a CFEmmy for Best
Newcomer. Thank you to those of you that nominated me. <a href="http://cfsilence.com/soundings/survey.cfm?id=EDCDE15B-FF9E-13A7-FC217BCDEDB0CC25">Vote Now</a> for your
favorite blog, host, OS project, community site, and more.</p>

<p>Thank you to Todd Sharp for conducting this once again this year. And thanks
again to those who nominated me for Best Newcomer. Whether I win or not, I can
surely say that this has truly been a great experience. When I graduated from
college I set a goal for myself to be active in this incredible community.
Without all of your help I would not be where I am today. You all are always
so willing to help and I truly appreciate it and the only way I can repay is
to give back what I have learned to the community.</p>

<p>Have a great Christmas and Holiday season!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are writing a function in ColdFusion that accepts a custom typed array
(com.hayes.project.component[] for example) and you don&#8217;t want to make it
required because it may not be provided, you can still use the default
argument with an untyped array:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>I was worried that it may error out when it used the default function to
create a new untyped Array. Once I thought about it, I decided to give it a
try and sure enough it works great.</p>

<p>One thing to note, however, that <a href="http://coldfusionjedi.com"></a>Ray mentioned to me was that ColdFusion
is lazy when it comes to validating typed Arrays. It only checks the first
element in the array to make sure it is of the type you specified.</p>

<p>To overcome this shortfall, when you are looping through the array and
accessing the elements&#8217; functions, simply wrap it in a try/catch in case the
elements after the first one are not of the appropriate type.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At work today I was trying to search for sites that use the Atlassian
Confluence wiki software. The product prints their name at the bottom of wiki
pages so I figured I would be able to get a decent amount of results from
simply typing <strong>atlassian confluence</strong> into Google. However, since that is
verbatim the name of the company and product, I was getting a lot of hits from
the Atlassian.com website.</p>

<p>I then decided I needed a way to not show any atlassian.com website. I don&#8217;t
consider myself a Google query guru, but I know about the site: parameter
where you can type site:disney.com or something to search only that site. So I
thought, what if I put the minus in front of that and maybe it would search
everywhere but that site.</p>

<p>Sure enough, it worked! Check it out:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s much easier to link directly to Adobe&#8217;s press-release:

<p>This is in regards to <a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/2007/11/abcs-of-amf.php">Ted&#8217;s</a> mention of changes coming to AMF soon. These
are excellent changes and updates. It will be great for Adobe and for the Flex
community.</p>

<blockquote><p>Concurrent with this prerelease of BlazeDS, Adobe is publishing the AMF
binary data protocol specification, on which the BlazeDS remoting
implementation is based, and is committed to partnering with the community to
make this protocol available for every major server platform. The source code
will be available for download early 2008. Please read the FAQ for further

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other day I attended an internal Flex user group meeting at Boeing. The
noticed that throughout the meeting, the host was pasting TinyURLs into the
chat window for the attendees to click on to various websites that were being
discussed.</p>

<p>This instantly gave me an idea of an AIR app that would allow a user to drag
and drop a URL from their browser onto the AIR application and have it
retrieve a TinyURL. My main goal of this application, besides it usefulness,
was to really show the rapid application development capabilities of Adobe
Flex + AIR in creating a desktop application. As soon as I got home from work
that day, I began working on it.</p>

<p>With about an hour development that day, and total of 1 hour of development
the next day (Thanksgiving) I had a fully working AIR application that did
exactly what I needed it to do. I am already finding it quite useful to use
and am sure you will to. You may use the installer below if you would like to
download and install the Adobe AIR Framework and TinyMe together:</p>

<p>Flash badge has been removed due to the new release of AIR Beta 3.</p>

<p>If the installer does not work, you may <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air.html">download Adobe AIR Beta 2</a>. Once
you have installed Adobe AIR Beta 2, you may <a href="http://www.kylehayes.info/tinyme/TinyMe_beta.air">download and install TinyMe</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Firefox 2 Mac does not work at this time with TinyMe. The issue with
Firefox 2 on the Mac has been fixed.</p>

<p>I just read in the news that Firefox 3.0 Beta was released today. I have been
keeping an eye on this release for quite some time as it will contain some
improvements that I, as a Mac user, have been wanting and asking for for a
long time.</p>

<p>The foremost reason why I have been watching this release is the simple fact
that pre-3.0 versions of Firefox have just been plain out ugly amongst the
gorgeous Aqua faÃ§ade of Mac OS X. Such things like any form widgets: buttons,
textboxes, select boxes, etc. These widgets were great boxy and very Netscape
1.0ish in my opinion. This issue was due to the very fact that the version of
Firefox for the Mac, did not use the native Cocoa framework to display widgets
on a webpage.</p>

<p>I believe about a year ago, it was finally announced that Firefox 3.0 was
going to be using the native Cocoa library on OS X to display any kind of page
widget. This immediately made me extremely happy.</p>

<p>In addition to the page widgets, the application in it&#8217;s entirety still looked
out of place. I think this had to do with the clear division of the toolbar
and the buttons below the toolbar.</p>

<p>For about six months now, I have been running Firefox (Minefield) 3.0a to keep
an eye on any changes. It was still fairly slow and lacked some other things
but it did have the native page widgets. I never liked it enough to switched
it to my default browser and continued to stick with Safari&#8211;especially when
Safari 3.0b came out.</p>

<p>Well, I just now <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2007/11/19/firefox-3-beta-1-now-available-for-download/">downloaded Firefox 3.0 Beta from Mozilla&#8217;s website</a> and I
must say, I am presently impressed with the work they have accomplished thus
far. The page widgets look great, there is a new unified toolbar at the top,
and its seems to be pretty responsive and fast.</p>

<p>I will attempt to use it as my default browser for as long as possible. Now
that the user interface things have been added, my main comparison will be
speed. I truly feel that Safari has Firefox beat on that one.</p>
