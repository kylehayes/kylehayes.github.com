  <div class="entry-content"><p>It is as simple as browsing to the following directory:</p>

<p><code>C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Local Settings\Application
Data\Google\Google Talk\themes\system\chat\[nameOfTheme]\Contents\Resources</code></p>

<p>and you will see a &#8220;main.css&#8221; file. When you open that file you can change any
of the CSS tags to change or create your own Google Talk theme.</p>

<p>A little explanation on the different classes. Look for the &#8220;DIV.out&#8221; tag.
This is the container in which the text that you type shows up in. The filter
property allows you to change the gradient that shows up behind your text
after you type. The startcolorStr is the top color of the gradient, and the
endColorStr is the bottom color.</p>

<p>That takes care of the background of the box. But you will still have to
change the top and bottom padding color of the box. The top is taken care of
with DIV.t-o. Change the background-color to the same one that you chose for
startColorStr and for DIV.b-o change it to the same one as endColorStr.</p>

<p>Also in the DIV.out class, you can add a &#8220;color:&#8221; attribute to change the
color of the text. With these basic explanations you can figure out what the
other classes in the file or for. The classes with an &#8220;in&#8221; prefix are for
designing the text as it is coming from your buddy.</p>

<p>You can download a theme that I made by clicking Download below. Simply
extract the file to this directory:</p>

<p><code>C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Local Settings\Application
Data\Google\Google Talk\themes\system\chat\</code></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/share/boeing.jpg" alt="" /> A little over a month ago, I saw a site called <a href="http://www.simplyhired.com">SimplyHired.com</a>
featured on a Web 2.0 list. As I am always intrigued by new Web 2.0 services I
checked it out. I typed in the search phrase &#8220;ColdFusion&#8221; and then I put in my
zip code. Seconds after searching, the site returned many results for jobs
that were related to ColdFusion. One specific job, however, caught my eye.
&#8220;Computing Process Specialist&#8221; for Boeing.</p>

<p>My fiancÃ© and I will be getting married this upcoming July on the 29th. We
are going to be living in Orange County. However, I am still working at the
church. I knew I needed to find a job at a real company. I have been casually
looking around to see what&#8217;s out there while I finish up my final quarter at
Cal Poly Pomona. The church hasn&#8217;t been making me all that happy with the way
they run things.</p>

<p>I clicked on the ad for the Boeing job position and signed up in ther job
posting system. I filled in my rÃ©sumÃ© information on their website and
waited. A couple of days later a received a call. They wanted me to come in
for an interview. The interview went well but I was not totally satisfied with
it. Over a month went by and I hadn&#8217;t heard anything from them, that is, until
a couple of days ago.</p>

<p>I received a call from the Staffing department of Boeing and they were pleased
to announce to me that they would like to offer a position to me once I
graduate from college in June. With utmost glee, I gladly and excitedly
accepted the position in my head.</p>

<p>I apologize for the way this entry was written but I wanted to make it brief
and it is very late at night.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After browsing for a good Flash JPG Roatator on the Internet, I finally found
a great one that was created by <a href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=Flash_JPG_Rotator">Jeroen Wijering</a>. The rotator is great!
That is until I got numerous reports by people using Internet Explorer that
after the first round of rotations, the banner goes blank!</p>

<p>Considering this banner is on a fairly high traffic site (www.calvarycch.org),
I couldn&#8217;t allow this to be a problem. I went onto the <a href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?thread=No_pictures_after_1st_rotation">forums</a> for this
project and many other people had a similar problem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally got around to installing Linux on my desktop PC. I had problems
installing it on the same physical harddrive as Windows, so I forked out $100
for a new SATA 250GB drive.</p>

<p>I got the drive a couple of days ago and started installing Fedora Core 5.
About 45 minutes later, I rebooted the system and to my dismay it booted
directly into Windows. I realized that I may have gone through the
installation process a little to quickly and forgot to change the setting to
put the bootloader on the first disc.</p>

<p>I am considerably new to Linux and wasn&#8217;t sure how to install GRUB bootloader
so that it started instead of Windows. All you have to do is use any bootable
Linux disc, in this case I just used the same DVD I that installed Fedora
with, and at the boot prompt before the installation begins you type the
following:</p>

<p><code>boot: linux rescue</code></p>

<p>It then proceeds to ask you a couple of general localization questions. The
installer will attempt to locate your partition that contains Linux. Once it
does, it will mount it to the /mnt/sysimage directory. Once it does that, it
will take you to a command prompt. Simply type the following at the prompt to
change the root to your Linux install:</p>

<p><code># chroot /mnt/sysimage</code></p>

<p>Once you have done that you need to type the following. NOTE: I am using sda
in this example because I have a serial ata drive. If you have an IDE drive
then you would use hda:</p>

<p><code># grub-install /dev/sda</code></p>

<p>Unfortunately this did not work for me as I got this error:</p>

<p><code>/dev/sdb1 does not have any corresponding BIOS drive</code></p>

<p>After searching for the solution I found out I had to add a parameter to the
install:</p>

<p><code># grub-install --recheck /dev/sda</code></p>

<p>Once I did that and rebooted, it showed me my GRUB bootloader which worked for
both my Windows and Linux installations. It was perfect.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to list the items that I had for sale on Google Base on the front
page of the site. Knowing already that Google offered RSS feeds for many other
services they offer, I checked the list that displays only my items. I was sad
to see there wasn&#8217;t any syndication links.</p>

<p>Perturbed by this obstacle, I was determined to discover a way to do this. I
immediately began thinking how I could program it myself. Once I realized the
complications of doing so I decided against it. Then I remembered a post that
I had seen about a website that converted any website with news items or
repeating regions into a news feed xml file. This is of course for sites
without a syndication file.</p>

<p>The site is called <a href="http://www.feed43.com">Feed 43</a>. The way it works is you input the URL of the
page that you want to extract the news items from (can by any repeating
region, not just news). After it fetches the page, it shows you the source of
the webpage in a textbox. It then gives you a set of simple rules on how to
parse the information you need for your feed, such as title, link and
description of each item. Once you understand how the rules work, you can have
it test the rules which will tell you how many items it found and what the
text values are for each of the attributes. I am not going to go into too much
detail about how the rules work. The ruleset I used to create my syndication
file, which should work for any Google Base list is:</p>

<p>Global search value:</p>

<p><code>{%}</code></p>

<p>Item (repeatable) Search Pattern:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>{<em>} href=&#8221;{%}&#8221;{</em>} >{%}{*} {%}** `</p>

<p>Finally, once you have tweaked it the way you want, you tell it which rule
applies to which attribute and hit Preview. It will show you a preview of your
XML file as it may appear in an RSS reader.</p>

<p>From there, I now had an XML file to work with for use in ColdFusion and
formatting it for my page.</p>
