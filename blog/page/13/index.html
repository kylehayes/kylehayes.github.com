  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I woke up this morning to write a blog entry and to my dismay, my website
was gone. I immediately recognized the placeholder site as a typical domain
expired page. I am really good at renewing my domains, when I saw this I could
not believe it!</p>

<p>I thought I had transferred all my domains to <a href="http://www.namecheap.com">NameCheap.com</a>, whom I have
had great service from, but it seems I missed one&#8230;one very important domain.
I looked it up and it was still with the crappy <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=registerfly+sucks&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">RegisterFly registrar</a>.</p>

<p>I knew this company was in a lot of trouble and has been for a couple of years
now. Nonetheless I did some digging and some research. It turns out, not only
has this company lost their <a href="http://www.icann.org">ICANN</a> accreditation, but they are also not
really in the business anymore.</p>

<p>Then I read that all the domains that were in the database for RegisterFly
were supposed to be transferred to GoDaddy. I gave them a few calls and they
did not have record of the domain. They informed me that only some of the
domains were transferred to them, and the others were kept at the respective
company&#8217;s that RegisterFly has resold from.</p>

<p>That meant for me, <a href="http://www.enom.com">eNom</a>. After numerous calls and waiting and patience, I
was finally able to get the domain transferred for eNom to control completely
and get the domain paid for and renewed. Happily, everything is up and running
now and I have definitely learned my lesson.</p>

<p>By the way, what registrars do you all like out there?</p>

ColdFusion 8 now. I can really see the difference in speed increase on this

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230; that is in the world of Google searches. Take a look at the following
chart: <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=coldfusion%2C+actionscript&amp;ctab=0&amp;hl=en&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0">Google Trends: ColdFusion vs. ActionScript</a></p>

<p>I find it very interesting that the two languages literally crossed paths.
Seems to be around the time that Flex became more popular.</p>

<p>Any comments on this? I am just curious to some general thoughts and musings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>The Adobe Flash Player is a multimedia application created by Macromedia
(now a division of Adobe Systems). Flash Player features support for both
vector and raster graphics, along with a scripting language and bidirectional
streaming of video and audio content. The player is a virtual machine that
runs Flash files, which are often embedded in websites to present animations,
games, GUIs, or other visual interestingness. If you&#8217;re reading this website,
you probably know all of this. What you might not know is that Flash sucks. It
is the bane of the Internet, and it needs to go away.</p></blockquote>

<p>Did I get your attention? I saw an article on the <a href="http://digg.com/programming/Why_Flash_Sucks">Digg</a> and had to read it
due to my love and loyalty for Adobe and Macromedia. After reading the
article, I agreed with what Mike was saying about some of the stuff, but for
the most part, I really feel it is the developer&#8217;s fault for creating, what he
calls, &#8220;sucky&#8221; sites. Any tools put into the hands of the wrong person will
result in garbage.</p>

<p>He cannot blame the platform saying that it sucks because it allows people to
create &#8220;sucky&#8221; stuff. If it was the platforms fault, then we could certainly
say just about this of any technology on the Internet. Look at all those sucky
HTML pages in the past with flashing backgrounds, movings
sentences/images/tables, intricate background textures and table borders up
the ying yang.</p>

<p>Saying that Flash sucks because of the reasons he gives is just simply
ridiculous. Anybody else have any comments on the matter?</p>

<p>If you agree with me, please bury this article on Digg:

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/share/tivohd.gif" alt="" />After my wife and I purchased our new LG 42&#8221; LCD HDTV in February this
year, we quickly realized that our less than 6 month old Tivo Series2 was not
going to suffice in quality for recording programs.</p>

<p>We are both huge Tivo brand fans and really enjoy using the service.
Especially with my wife&#8217;s odd and unpredictable work schedule, it really suits
us well. After scoffing at the price of a new Tivo Series3 which does support
HD, we decided against it and to wait for a really slammin deal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we decided to use the built in HD DVR that came integrated with our
LG screen. We figured this would be great, until we discovered all the
downfalls that it had. Things like</p>

<ul>
<li>Not being able to resume your recorded program if you stop and come back</li>
<li>Halt you from viewing a recorded program if one was recording at the same time and it finishes recording</li>
<li>Really bad searching and scheduling</li>
<li>Uses the integrated TV Guide interface which is clumsy, slow, and unorganized</li>
<li>Etc, etc, etc</li>
</ul>


<p>Needless to say, when I heard about the release of the Tivo HD last week, I
was very very excited&#8211;especially when I saw the $300 price tag, compared to
the $600 tag of the Series3 (from Amazon.com, retail is $800).</p>

<p>It is built on the Series3 technology. The only major thing that it differs
from the Series3 is 10 less hours of HD recording time (putting it at about 20
hours I believe) and it only works with those who subscribe to Cable service
(sorry satellite folks).</p>

<p>We went out to Best Buy last night and purchased it, and are loving it. We are
so happy to have it back!</p>

<p>I may post more reviews about it, as I use it more, but so far it is really
quite wonderful. Oh and by the way, there is a port on the back labeled eSATA
- External Storage&#8230;<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/04/how-to-use-your-tivo-series3-esata-port-to-add-an-external-driv/">hmmmmm</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After noodling around in <a href="http://kevinlangdon.com/serviceCapture/">Service Capture</a> to watch the calls that were
being made from the Pownce AIR file, I began working on a CFC to interact with
the unofficial Pownce API.</p>

<p>After numerous attempts and a great deal of pain figuring out as well as <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pownceapi/browse_thread/thread/777102ccebad37e1">help
from the newly created PownceAPI Google Group</a>, I got my CFC to work.</p>

<p>Currently you can only get all your notes from Pownce. But this is a great
start! The hardest part about that was the password digest authentication
string that you have to pass to Pownce. Everything else is just a matter of
method calls.</p>

<p>I dropped the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cfpownce/">project into Google Code</a> as well as <a href="http://cfpownce.riaforge.org">RIAForge</a>.</p>

<p>My planned features for this are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add ability to post notes</li>
<li>Add ability to post links</li>
<li>Add ability to post files</li>
<li>Get only specific notes by date, type etc.</li>
<li>Build a HTML webpage client</li>
<li>Build a Flex webpage client</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After numerous attempts of interacting with the Pownce API (based on what I
was digging through in the communications between the AIR client and the
server) I still was not able to connect and get data. I was able to call
/api/available/ and get a 200 OK, as well as /api/login/ and get a login token
as well. But when it came to getting the list of posts via
/api/notes/for/kylehayes/, I passed in the right information and compiled my
WSSE passwordDigest as <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/17/dive.html">per the instructions</a>, it still did not work.</p>

<p>However, through my Googling, I found someone that was <a href="http://phaedo.cx/archives/2007/07/16/pownce-api-broken/">trying to do exactly
what I was trying to do</a>, only instead of making the API calls in
ColdFusion like I was, he was doing it in Python.</p>

<p>Well, Clint was successful last night. He managed to create a some functions
in Python that are able to send the four different types of messages to the
public. <a href="http://phaedo.cx/archives/2007/07/16/using-the-pownce-api-very-rough/">His post</a> is rather detailed, but thanks to the simplicity of
Python, most developers should be able to read it.</p>

<p>He also announced this morning, <a href="http://phaedo.cx/archives/2007/07/17/pypownce-project-on-google-code/">PyPounce on Google code</a>.</p>

<p>Good job, Clint! The community is excited to jump in and get started.</p>

<p>P.S. Clint, listen to your boss&#8230;ColdFusion is a pretty neat language.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I asked <a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/index.php">Ted</a> (as well as <a href="http://pownce.com/kylehayes/notes/221880/">pulsed the public Pownce</a>) today if there was
a way to make an image component show up behind another component; similar to
the functionality of &#8220;Send to Back&#8221; in Illustrator without the explicit
instruction to do so. Happily, he responded that this was definitely possible
and to use the DisplayList API. He said that children of a displayObject are
ordered by index in Z order. When you addChild, they are added to the front.</p>

<p>You can also use addChildAt to reposition them. With this information, I asked
him if you could only reposition at runtime (which I could not have imagined
being the case as Adobe just doesn&#8217;t overlook things like this). Surely he
responded that MXML, being the hierarchal language that it is, it sets the
components in their Z order by order of your component tags.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>The <strong>button</strong> is on top of the <strong>panel</strong> which is on top of the <strong>image</strong>,
meaning that the image is in the &#8220;background&#8221; (though not the actual
background of Application as set forth by the backgroundImage attribute).</p>

<p>Here are some links that Ted provided to learn more about the DisplayList API:</p>
