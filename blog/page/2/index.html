  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know it is cliché to write a post about trying a new service that posts but
I gotta do it to give it a swing! I used to be a very frequent blogger over at
kylehayes.info in my ColdFusion days, but haven&#8217;t touched it much lately
because of how busy I&#8217;ve been. I figured if I can just send an email to write
a post about something, I just might be more apt to blog more frequently.
Although, that could mean that the quality of my content goes down, who knows,
we&#8217;ll see!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s no surprise that I&#8217;m a huge advocate and fan of the <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org" title="DojoToolkit.org">Dojo toolkit</a>
when it comes to quality JavaScript development. It consistently delivers
quality results in my websites and web applications while also helping to keep
my code very maintainable and reusable. However, it&#8217;s also no surprise that
Dojo is not the most popular JavaScript toolkit. This is due to many factors,
one of which is the lack of strong marketing. It&#8217;s my desire to help and
support the Dojo team where I can especially in this area since it lacks so
much by offering a free newsletter to subscribers over at <a href="http://startdojo.com/?cmp=khnlpromo" title="Sign up for the free newsletter at StartDojo.com">StartDojo.com</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Christian Hellman wrote another excellent JavaScript article over at <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing
Magazine</a>. This time he addresses styles and techniques of coding that is
widely supported, accepted, and expected by good JavaScript developers. If
you’ve been programming JavaScript for awhile, you’ll notice much of the stuff
is different now than it was less than a decade ago now that JavaScript has
evolved and improved based on the  needs of the JavaScript community as well
as the capabilities of modern-day browsers.</p>

<p>Personally, the ones I’ve fallen victim to most recently are shortcut
notations. Having a Java background, I always wanted to create new Objects and
Arrays using the “new” keyword and constructing. During the writing of
<a href="http://startdojo.com/buy">Getting Started with Dojo</a>, Peter Higgins (the technical reviewer) pounded
in my head that today, objects are created like var foo = {} and arrays are
created like var bar = []. Christian discusses this in the article (and a bit
more in detail).</p>

<p>Using JSON as a data format is another one I can strongly relate to,
especially with his mention of using arrays and delimited strings in the past.
Today, there will not be a project that goes by where I need data brought in
and I will always choose JSON if it’s available due to its native support in
modern day JavaScript.</p>

<p>I personally am always looking for ways to make my JavaScript run faster. As
developers, we so often get caught up in the moment of getting something to
work and simply implement a solution in a way that just came natural and was
easy, we don’t go back to see if we can make it more efficient—especially in
terms of browser memory usage. There have been many times I’ve seen a simple
for loop accessing data in a way that is calling another method to fetch the
data, instead of caching the data once and accessing the local cache.
Christian brought up another way to make your page more efficient in terms of
events that I had not thought of. His example perfectly illustrates a
situation in which you want to listen for the click event on a set of list
items inside an unordered list. Instead of looping through each list item and
adding an event handler, you can simply add an event handler to the parent of
this list (the ul). From here you can determine which li was clicked. This
assuming that you understand that events in the DOM roll up from the bottom
when an event occurs. This means that if you click an li,if that click is not
handled on the li, it will roll up to the ul and so forth.</p>

<p>Finally the last few points on anonymous functions with the module pattern,
configuration, interacting with the back end, and browser specific code, I
cannot stress enough to read and understand these the best you can. These four
points that he clearly makes are utterly important in ensuring you are an
efficient JavaScript developer. This will set you apart from being a good
JavaScript dev, to an excellent JavaScript dev—proving you know how the
language works and how to best control it and use it as it should be used.</p>

<p>I highly respect Christian’s articles and his advice and I recommend you head
his comments where you see fit. You can read the full article on Smashing
Magazine below:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With all the buzz of HTML5, most of it has been centered around the new video
and canvas tags, however, so much more is being added and spec’ed out. One
particular area that has been given some much needed love is forms.</p>

<p>Some new form input types that we get are:</p>

<ul>
<li>search</li>
<li>tel</li>
<li>url</li>
<li>email</li>
<li>datetime, date, month, week, time, and datetime-local</li>
<li>number</li>
<li>range</li>
<li>color</li>
</ul>


<p>Along with that, some validation. But what browsers are supporting this new
functionality? Check out the litmus tests here: <a href="http://cl.ly/4Bq">http://cl.ly/4Bq</a></p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>See if your browser passes the HTML5 &#8220;Acid&#8221; test: <a href="http://html5test.com/">http://html5test.com/</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Part of agile software development is the practice of acceptance testing to
ensure the appropriate business requirements, use cases, and ensure confidence
in the delivered product. This process is commonly recommended to be automated
so the tests can be easily run at a given time as well as be consistent. James
Shore created and encouraged the agile community to use his automated testing
framework (Fit) to create these tests.</p>

<p>The problem is that it was meant for the business to be creating these tests,
not the developers, however, it turns out that the developers were tasked with
creating them instead which is a “maintenance burden”.</p>

<p>Shore now believes that automating the acceptance testing is <em>not</em> a good
idea, summarized by the following two points:</p>

<p>1.       The real planned benefit of an automated acceptance tool, like Fit,
was that the business folks (&#8220;customers&#8221;) would write executable examples
themselves. History has shown that very rarely occurs. In a few cases testers
do, but in the majority of cases these tests are written by the developers.</p>

<p>2.       These tests often become a real maintenance burden, as they are slow
and brittle, and often hard to refactor. On this point, that end-to-end
&#8220;integration tests&#8221; present a higher cost than they are worth, JB Rainsberger
has a <a href="http://jbrains.ca/category/named/integrated-tests-are-a-scam">great series of articles</a> explaining his rational why.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came across a neat site called dummyimage.com that allows you to append an
image size to it&#8217;s URL as so: <a href="http://dummyimage.com/300x250">http://dummyimage.com/300x250</a>. However,
what I didn&#8217;t like about it, is that I could not add text to the image to
describe what the image is a placeholder for. I took upon myself to create my
own service that does this and I plan on expanding it to do more as well.</p>

<p>Last night I created <a href="http://fpoimg.com">fpoimg.com</a>. It works in very much the same way as
dummyimage.com, only you can add text to your images. The next iteration of
the site will allow you to change the colors of the background and foreground.
Anyway, the way you use the site is if you want to create a basic placeholder
or FPO (For Placement Only) image you simply go to
<a href="http://fpoimg.com/345x480">http://fpoimg.com/345x480</a> and the image will be provided to you. You can
save this image if you like, or you can refer to it directly in your code such
as in an image tag: <code>&lt;img src="http://fpoimg.com/345x480"&gt;</code></p>

<p>The first number is your width in pixels, the second is your height in pixels.
Additionally, if you want to add some text to the image to describe it as a
placeholder, you simply append that to the URL as so:
<a href="http://fpoimg.com/200x200/Advertisement">http://fpoimg.com/345x480/Advertisement</a></p>

<p>This will create the following image:</p>

<p><img src="http://fpoimg.com/345x480/Advertisement" alt="" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s really that basic! Here are some more examples: <img src="http://fpoimg.com/300x250/MREC" alt="" /> <img src="http://fpoimg.com/728x90/Banner" alt="" /></p>

<p>I of course do plan on tweaking this service as needed such as caching the
images and providing the ability to change their colors. If the service
becomes more popular, I have a feeling I&#8217;ll need to invoke some kind of limit
as well so as not to crash the server.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The book that I&#8217;ve been writing for the past nine months is finally published
and available for purchase. Below are the details as posted on the companion
site, <a href="http://startdojo.com" title="Go to startdojo.com">startdojo.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Getting StartED with Dojo is finally available for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430225211?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=startdojo-com-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1430225211">purchase</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=startdojo-com-200&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1430225211" alt="" />!
About nine months ago I was approached by Apress to author a book on the <a href="http://">Dojo
toolkit</a>. After a long journey of authoring my first book, the final phase
is complete as the book is now officially published and out in the wild. While
the actual publish date was December 28th, I&#8217;m sure it will be a little while
before you start seeing it on the shelves of popular brick and mortar
bookstore shelves such as Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble. For now, you can
certainly <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430225211?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=startdojo-com-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1430225211">order it on Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=startdojo-com-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1430225211" alt="" />.</p></blockquote>

<p>Getting StartED with Dojo has fan page on Facebook: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Getting-StartED-with-Dojo/224855113411" title="Getting StartED with Dojo">Getting StartED with

<p>You may also <a href="http://twitter.com/startdojo" title="Follow @startdojo on Twitter!">follow @startdojo on Twitter</a> for up to date news and
information relating to the Dojo toolkit and community.</p>

<p>I will mostly be using this site for updates to the book such as corrections
to the code and copy. In addition, I will be posting tips and resources for
learning more about the Dojo toolkit. A lot of work went into the creation of
this book and I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<a href="http://www.apress.com">Apress</a> / <a href="http://www.friendsofed.com">Friends of ED</a> to write a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430225211?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cf0d-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1430225211">book</a> on the <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org">Dojo JavaScript
Toolkit</a>. It&#8217;s been quite the journey to say the least. It has been a
desire of mine in the past few years to publish a technical book. When Apress
approached me, I couldn&#8217;t resist. It&#8217;s been a lot of work but it&#8217;s almost
done. You can check it out and pre-order it on Amazon.com! Needless to say
I&#8217;ve had my head in Dojo quite a bit the past few months.</p>

<p>With that, I&#8217;ve also been working on a very large project at work that I&#8217;m one
of the technical leads on. That project is the <a href="http://family.go.com/gapcastingcall/">Gap Casting Call</a> which is
a contest that Gap runs every year to find the next faces of BabyGap and
GapKids. They partnered with us at Family.com to build and host the online
photo contest. Enter your kids to get a chance at winning! There are a lot of
great <a href="http://family.go.com/gapcastingcall/prizes/">prizes</a> and a lot of great <a href="http://family.go.com/gapcastingcall/galleries/">entries</a>!</p>

<p>On to my next project at work where I get to learn and use GWT. More to come
in the future I&#8217;m sure. Until then, thanks for staying up to date with me, and
sorry it has been so long since I&#8217;ve posted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Reading <a href="https://twitter.com/remotesynth/status/1935994201">Brian&#8217;s tweet</a> this morning, I decided to read more about this
whole OOP Debate. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t really have time, nor the interest
to read Marc&#8217;s <a href="http://www.advantexllc.com/blog/post.cfm/how-oo-almost-destroyed-my-business">entire post</a>. But I read as far to the point where he comes
to the epiphany that CF is not Java and that it can&#8217;t handle the same patterns
the same way that Java can&#8230;um&#8230;duh! I thought this was a known fact about
ColdFusion / CFML. Rewind many years to the creation of ColdFusion&#8211;that was
the whole point of coming up with ColdFusion was to have a language that did
not require the sheer complexity of languages like C and CGIs to connect to
databases. I think for the most part, ColdFusion has always aimed to be easy
or easier and less code etc. If you want to program more along the lines of
what Java supports and the patterns it uses, then use Java. Seriously.
ColdFusion is not Java and it shouldn&#8217;t be. It should be what it is and do it
well.</p>

<p>With that, here is my comment to <a href="http://www.remotesynthesis.com/post.cfm/this-oop-debate-isn-t-about-oop-at-all">Brian&#8217;s response</a> to this debate:</p>

<blockquote><p>I agree with you, Brian, in that his post may have been partly about the
aspect you allude to. However, I also feel there is a real frustration in what
he is really expressing with OO and CF. I noticed this same type of demeanor
with some folks over the years when I strongly worked with CF. I myself have a
Java background and as such tried to make CF follow the patterns and paradigms
in the way that Java did. At the same time, I also recognized where CF fell
short and thus worked with CF in it&#8217;s capacity as opposed to trying to get it
to fit into the same context that Java is in.</p></blockquote>

<p>With that, I encouraged other folks who worked with me to learn the better
structured concepts of OO and MVC patterns and using the right mix of
frameworks, such as a MVC, ORM, and IOC framework. The problem is, if you
don&#8217;t understand these concepts from a fundamental level from the beginning
without ever mixing CF in, they can be very overwhelming and start to crush
the positive attitude that a CFML programmer may have.</p>

<p>Much of the time I also felt that parts of the community were pushing the use
of so many patterns it was ridiculous and I think this is the storm that
perhaps Marc was feeling.</p>

<p>To reiterate, I do feel that what you mentioned could be an underlying tone
and perhaps fueling of anger and frustration, but at the same time I know from
other CFML developers that I used to work with, his feelings at that show on
the surface are valid and understood.</p>

<p>I think that most of the expert CFML developers in the community know and
understand the limitations of the technology. Keep in mind, however,
limitations is defined by what the requirements of a project are. Projects&#8217;
requirements should be written around the technology being used. Perhaps
ColdFusion doesn&#8217;t have limitations in the sense of the word when it comes to
&#8220;industry standard patterns&#8221;. From it&#8217;s beginning, it has always defined it&#8217;s
own set of patterns that work for the CFML workflow. Developer&#8217;s need to
understand to not try to redefine something that doens&#8217;t need to be redefined.
If they have different needs in a project that are strong enough to fully set
the project&#8217;s scope outside the circle of ColdFusion, then they need to choose
a different technology.</p>

<p>CF continues to have a strong closely-knit community, something I have always
enjoyed about it. Embrace the community, but don&#8217;t forget that at the end of
the day, it&#8217;s up to you how you want to program your applications. And yes
patterns are good, but don&#8217;t overdo it. Allow yourself to focus on the tasks
at hand as well as having good design at the same time. True, not EVERYTHING
needs to be &#8220;OO&#8221;.</p>

<p>Finally, change rarely comes at the perfect time. As web developers, the past
5 years or so have been changing very rapidly with new languages, patterns,
frameworks, libraries coming out every day it seems. Don&#8217;t focus on being up
to date on every single one and figure out how you can use each of them in
your next project. Pick and choose what you want to learn and learn it well.
In a time such as now, stick with what you know cause you need to hold on for
a little bit longer, there are some rough winds up ahead.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m serious when I say don&#8217;t redefine something that is not meant to be that
in the first place. I always uphold innovation in it&#8217;s highest regards, but
there is innovation and then there is redefinition. They are NOT the same
thing, so stop!</p>
