<div class="entry-content"><p>Reading <a href="https://twitter.com/remotesynth/status/1935994201">Brian&#8217;s tweet</a> this morning, I decided to read more about this
whole OOP Debate. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t really have time, nor the interest
to read Marc&#8217;s <a href="http://www.advantexllc.com/blog/post.cfm/how-oo-almost-destroyed-my-business">entire post</a>. But I read as far to the point where he comes
to the epiphany that CF is not Java and that it can&#8217;t handle the same patterns
the same way that Java can&#8230;um&#8230;duh! I thought this was a known fact about
ColdFusion / CFML. Rewind many years to the creation of ColdFusion&#8211;that was
the whole point of coming up with ColdFusion was to have a language that did
not require the sheer complexity of languages like C and CGIs to connect to
databases. I think for the most part, ColdFusion has always aimed to be easy
or easier and less code etc. If you want to program more along the lines of
what Java supports and the patterns it uses, then use Java. Seriously.
ColdFusion is not Java and it shouldn&#8217;t be. It should be what it is and do it
well.</p>

<p>With that, here is my comment to <a href="http://www.remotesynthesis.com/post.cfm/this-oop-debate-isn-t-about-oop-at-all">Brian&#8217;s response</a> to this debate:</p>

<blockquote><p>I agree with you, Brian, in that his post may have been partly about the
aspect you allude to. However, I also feel there is a real frustration in what
he is really expressing with OO and CF. I noticed this same type of demeanor
with some folks over the years when I strongly worked with CF. I myself have a
Java background and as such tried to make CF follow the patterns and paradigms
in the way that Java did. At the same time, I also recognized where CF fell
short and thus worked with CF in it&#8217;s capacity as opposed to trying to get it
to fit into the same context that Java is in.</p></blockquote>

<p>With that, I encouraged other folks who worked with me to learn the better
structured concepts of OO and MVC patterns and using the right mix of
frameworks, such as a MVC, ORM, and IOC framework. The problem is, if you
don&#8217;t understand these concepts from a fundamental level from the beginning
without ever mixing CF in, they can be very overwhelming and start to crush
the positive attitude that a CFML programmer may have.</p>

<p>Much of the time I also felt that parts of the community were pushing the use
of so many patterns it was ridiculous and I think this is the storm that
perhaps Marc was feeling.</p>

<p>To reiterate, I do feel that what you mentioned could be an underlying tone
and perhaps fueling of anger and frustration, but at the same time I know from
other CFML developers that I used to work with, his feelings at that show on
the surface are valid and understood.</p>

<p>I think that most of the expert CFML developers in the community know and
understand the limitations of the technology. Keep in mind, however,
limitations is defined by what the requirements of a project are. Projects&#8217;
requirements should be written around the technology being used. Perhaps
ColdFusion doesn&#8217;t have limitations in the sense of the word when it comes to
&#8220;industry standard patterns&#8221;. From it&#8217;s beginning, it has always defined it&#8217;s
own set of patterns that work for the CFML workflow. Developer&#8217;s need to
understand to not try to redefine something that doens&#8217;t need to be redefined.
If they have different needs in a project that are strong enough to fully set
the project&#8217;s scope outside the circle of ColdFusion, then they need to choose
a different technology.</p>

<p>CF continues to have a strong closely-knit community, something I have always
enjoyed about it. Embrace the community, but don&#8217;t forget that at the end of
the day, it&#8217;s up to you how you want to program your applications. And yes
patterns are good, but don&#8217;t overdo it. Allow yourself to focus on the tasks
at hand as well as having good design at the same time. True, not EVERYTHING
needs to be &#8220;OO&#8221;.</p>

<p>Finally, change rarely comes at the perfect time. As web developers, the past
5 years or so have been changing very rapidly with new languages, patterns,
frameworks, libraries coming out every day it seems. Don&#8217;t focus on being up
to date on every single one and figure out how you can use each of them in
your next project. Pick and choose what you want to learn and learn it well.
In a time such as now, stick with what you know cause you need to hold on for
a little bit longer, there are some rough winds up ahead.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m serious when I say don&#8217;t redefine something that is not meant to be that
in the first place. I always uphold innovation in it&#8217;s highest regards, but
there is innovation and then there is redefinition. They are NOT the same
thing, so stop!</p>
