<div class="entry-content"><p>Whilst on the subway from work to Union Station in LA, I read an interesting
and inspiring article in this month&#8217;s issue of <em>Outdoor Photographer</em>. It was
an article titled <em>Don&#8217;t Prove&#8230;Improve!,</em> authored by nature photographer
Dewitt Jones. Jones narrated the story of his first published photo which was
in <em>National Geographic</em> and the experience he had in gaining a position there
as a photographer. The aspect he was highlighting the most was the discussion
he had with Bob Gilka, head of photography at <em>National Geographic. </em>Gilka
provided a bit of sound advice that can certainly be applied to the
programming field. Gilka told Jones that he was going to be working with the
best photographers in the world and that Jones didn&#8217;t need to prove himself to
Gilka or any of the other photographers he worked with. But the one thing he
did ask from Jones was to <em>improve</em> himself—always aspire to be a better
photographer.</p>

<p>This statement alone was enough to get me thinking about how relevant this was
to me as a programmer, especially on a team of other programmers. I think it&#8217;s
human nature for people to feel like they need to prove themselves to others
and in some cases that&#8217;s true, but for day-to-day tasks and projects that you
are collaborating with a team of people just like you, it&#8217;s pertinent to
remember the advice Gilka so sincerely offered.</p>

<p>Gilka went on to say that his photographers are expected to share and learn
from the other photographers. In other words, if you know of a technique,
share with your team; if you&#8217;re in need of critique, be humbled and let others
share with you. As programmers, there is no reason why we shouldn&#8217;t follow
this same mantra; we should be lifting each other up and providing
encouragement.</p>

<p>I work on a team where we get to work on some pretty great projects and so
much of the time our pride can get in the way of great development,
collaboration, and growth. This can cause issues from a few angles such as
being protective of one&#8217;s code rather than looking at it as the team&#8217;s code
and receiving feedback as a team to make it better. All in all it prevents the
team from moving forward and progressing in terms of skills, technology,
innovation, and team cohesion.</p>

<p>Jones describes his interaction with one of the photographers he met as well
as others he got to know with the following quote, &#8220;Technical help, honest
criticism and enthusiastic encouragement came from many, and my learning curve
went up with the trajectory of a space shuttle launch.&#8221; How many of you can
say the same thing about where you work? If you can, that&#8217;s fantastic! I would
guess that it&#8217;s not the case for many.</p>

<p>He goes on to make another good point that over the years he has seen so many
photographers waste time proving themselves to others that they missed the
opportunities to spend those same hours &#8220;improving their technique and
sharpening their eye&#8221;. How much better could we improve our development skills
with this at the forefront of our minds?</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the solution? How can you bring this into your team? For starters, you
can encourage your team to be more open. Speak to them about the benefits of
having an openness such as is described above. They likely won&#8217;t come around
instantly, but over time, the more you encourage this type of behavior, the
more it will become natural and easy. It&#8217;s also good to encourage community
code reviews where everyone and anyone can see and review code in a non-
demeaning manner. Again, it&#8217;s for everyone&#8217;s own good—to help them grow—to
help the team grow.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts? Can you relate to this?</p>
