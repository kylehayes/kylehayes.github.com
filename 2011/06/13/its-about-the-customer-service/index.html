<div class="entry-content"><p>Some companies get it, some don&#8217;t; quality customer service <em>does</em> matter and
<em>does</em> leave a lasting impression. From the time an individual first walks
into a store, logs in online, or approaches the host/hostess at a restaurant,
the subconscious evaluation of customer service begins. Akin to first
impressions when meeting someone for the first time, immediately you begin
making judgements about how you are treated, e.g., whether you were greeted in
a courteous manner, asked if you need help, etc. From this point forward, it&#8217;s
the company&#8217;s duty to draw you in, and give you reason to hand over your hard
earned money in exchange for their product or service. You likely preconceived
doing this anyway otherwise you would not have approached them in the first
place. However, there are many alternatives and you could change your mind and
go somewhere else if you&#8217;ve not found what you&#8217;re looking for or you&#8217;ve not
received the service you expect.</p>

<p>I am constantly on the lookout for companies and organizations who treat their
customers well. In many cases, I&#8217;m likely to pay more for a product or service
to receive such quality treatment. Some of the companies who top my list are
those whom offer great customer service that may not be known for it or may be
less expected to are Zappos.com, Apple, Amazon.com, and Costco. They have no
particular obligation as say Nordstrom does in offering the best service in
their industry. Yet, they understand the value. I&#8217;ve had a couple of
interactions with each of these recently and would like to lay them out
beginning with Apple.</p>

<h2>Apple</h2>

<p>One evening when making spiced apple cider last autumn, I received a phone
call. I went to pick up my iPhone and unlocked it—as I did, the phone some how
slipped out of my hand and plopped, fully submerged into the large bowl of hot
apple cider (slightly ironic). I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever reacted to something so
quickly! I reached into the bowl to save the life of my iPhone, wiped it down
and took a can of compressed air to try and get as much liquid out as
possible. All seemed fine and it appeared to have been saved—until the next
day. Unfortunately whatever damage had been done had set into the electronics
of the phone and I was not able to hear the person on the other line very well
when listening to the earpiece. Naturally, I was quite bummed.</p>

<p>After much consideration, I decided I was going to take it to the Genius Bar
at my local Apple Store to see how much it was going to cost to repair. For
all my mobile Apple products, I always buy AppleCare as I&#8217;ve found it&#8217;s
usually pretty good insurance. Unfortunately, one of the things AppleCare does
not cover is liquid damage. Nonetheless, I committed to myself I was going to
tell the truth and not try to be like some of those people that I&#8217;ve seen go
in and claim that the phone was not dropped in water even though the genius
can clearly see that the liquid sensors in the iPhone have been activated.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the Apple store, I told the genius exactly what had
happened. She was very understanding and asked to look at the iPhone to see if
the liquid sensors had been damaged. After about five minutes, she came back
and said the liquid sensors were not activated and questioned tongue-in-cheek,
&#8220;so, you&#8217;re having trouble with your speaker, huh? Well, geez, that&#8217;s
unfortunate, we need to get a replacement iPhone for you to see if that
resolves the issue.&#8221; I was thrilled as she had just finished telling me it was
going to be something in the range of $250 to get it replaced. <em>This</em> is
customer service.</p>

<h2>Amazon.com</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve long been a customer of Amazon.com and am a strong advocate of their
retail philosophies. There are many things that I love about their shopping
experience, from their breadth of product offerings, to their Prime shipping
service. However, I would like to focus on their Subscribe &amp; Save service. If
you have not had the pleasure of ordering a product with Subscribe &amp; Save, I
highly recommend you find something of interest and give it a try, it really
is worth it.</p>

<p>Offered on a limited set of products that you would likely purchase routinely,
Subscribe &amp; Save allows you to opt-in to receive a designated item or usually
a multi-pack of items every so often. For example, one of the things I have
subscribed to is three packages of cat litter for our automatic litterbox. I
receive these three cartons of litter every three months and it is
automatically shipped. The advantages are for the customer is 1) you can
cancel any time so you are not obligated to a pre-determined number of
shipments, 2) you get free shipping on the item, 3) you get a 15% discount off
the purchase price and 4) you get to choose the delivery frequency. Pretty
sweet deal if you ask me. One might think that this is one of those marketing
ploys where they make the offer look attractive by getting you to sign up and
making it difficult to unsubscribe or they don&#8217;t warn you when a shipment is
about to go out to give you enough time to cancel. I&#8217;m happy to report it is
not at all like this. In fact, Amazon sends you an email a few days before the
shipment leaves the warehouse to give you time to cancel. <em>This</em> is customer
service.</p>

<h2>Costco</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a member of Costco for quite some time as they consistently offer
quality products. I find the small membership fee to be well worth the value
and service I get from this retailer. If you are familiar with Costco, you are
probably also familiar with their lifetime unconditional guarantee they offer
on most of their products (&#8220;most?&#8221;, yes, unfortunately customers began abusing
the system on things like computers, televisions, and cell phones, so they had
to limit some items to a three month guarantee). This incredible guarantee
states that if you are ever dissatisfied with any product or purchase you
make, you can return the item(s) for a full refund, no questions asked.</p>

<p>I have known about this little perk for some time now, but never had the
oppotunity to utilize it—until recently. A year and a half ago, I purchased an
HP inkjet printer from Costco. I&#8217;ve been a long time fan of HP, until the past
couple of printers and ink supplies I&#8217;ve purchased. This printer worked pretty
well for the first six months. However, the next six months it got really bad
with paper jams so much so that only about 10% of our print jobs were
successful. I was really bummed, until I realized that this was an opportunity
to take advantage of the Costco guarantee. I called them up and asked if I
could bring the printer in for a refund, they responded that as long as I had
the receipt as well as the cables and such that came with it, it was not an
issue. I did just that. The process was very simple and was a very normal
return process—I didn&#8217;t even have the original box. <em>This</em> is customer
service.</p>

<h2>Zappos.com</h2>

<p>Finally, I would like to describe my most recent act of quality customer
service which was with Zappos.com. As someone who rarely has time to visit a
brick and mortar store to shop, especially for shoes, Zappos.com has become an
excellent convenience. While their prices seem to be standard and aren&#8217;t much
cheaper if I bought them in person some where, their service is incredible and
their model is second-to-none. For starters, they offer free shipping to you
<em>and</em> free shipping back to them if you decide to return your purchase. For
VIP members (which is no extra cost to become one), that shipping is
automatically upgraded to overnight. They take the baton even further by
offering a very user-friendly site that is clear, fast, and offers an
excellent alternative to in person shoe shopping—by providing pictures and
video of all angles of the shoe. Finally, to top it off, I had a specific
scenario that really made this company stand out.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;ve only ever purchased shoes from them, I decided to take a look at
the options they had for other clothes. I found a safe bet in a pair of jeans
that appeared to fit the bill and were at a good price point. I made the
purchase and went about my business. The next day I had the following email in
my inbox:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hello Kyle,</p></blockquote>

<p>We were unable to process your order for the Nautica Relaxed Fit Jean on order
number Order #[removed]. Please accept our sincerest apologies. Regrettably,
the merchandise did not pass our quality inspection and we do not have a
replacement available in stock in the size and color you requested.</p>

<p>Since the item is unavailable, we have canceled your order and voided the
authorization on your credit card. Please be advised that it could take your
bank 2-10 business days to release the authorization placed on your account
for this order.</p>

<p>We have conducted a search of other internet retailers and were unable to find
the item available elsewhere. In case you&#8217;d like to wait and see if we get
this item back in stock, we have added you to our &#8220;notify me&#8221; list. Being
placed on the &#8220;notify me&#8221; list does not require any obligation on your part.
Please review the link below for more information about our Notification List
and how it works:</p>

<p>http://www.zappos.com/general-questions#out-of-stock</p>

<p>This order is not indicative of the high quality of service and products we
strive to provide our customers. As a gesture of goodwill, we have issued a
$10.00 coupon which you may use toward your next purchase at Zappos.com. Below
is the coupon code you will need to receive your discount&#8230;.</p>

<p>I was astounded. How could an online retailer give me such joy after informing
they were not able to complete my order. Let&#8217;s point out a few items of
interest here.</p>

<p>First, I received this email the day after I made the purchase. In cases where
I have had back orders in the past with other retailers, the company has
notified me no less than a week later and they apologize then simply say it
will be in when it will be in.</p>

<p>The next point of good service is the very first point in the letter; they
inspected the item and it did not pass their standards of quality. When
ordering from an online retailer, this step is imperative yet so many miss it.
Zappos.com understands that the quality of the product is important and that
there is a chance that you will return it anyway if it is defective so they
might as well take an extra moment for this inspection to save everyone the
hassle later.</p>

<p>Following the inspection, they took the initiative to try and find the item
from a nearby supplier. Since they were not able to and instead of leaving me
in limbo indefinitely, they canceled my order to alive me of the burden of
having to do so myself and going somewhere else.</p>

<p>Honestly, getting this far in the letter, I&#8217;m already a very happy customer
(yes, even though I don&#8217;t have my product). To top things off even further,
Zappos.com assured me that this was not a normal occurrence for them and as a
nice gesture, they provided a $10 coupon to incentivize me to come back and to
help alleviate any inconvenience this may have caused. I can&#8217;t say enough how
important this one little letter is. <em>This</em> is customer service.</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s not all good</h2>

<p>The four previous examples are just a tiny fraction of stories out there about
quality customer service. There is also the flip side of the coin, those
companies who have <em>poor</em> customer service. I&#8217;m sure we could all name quite a
few companies that we consistently have bad service from and eventually you
learn just to avoid them where you can. I would only like to discuss a recent
scenario I had with the single-cup coffee manufacturer, Tassimo.</p>

<p>Up until this past winter, when I switched to Nespresso for a far superior
homemade espresso, I was a heavy consumer of Tassimo coffee and also a large
proponent of their brand. It did what it claimed and did it decently—well
enough for me to maintain a Tassimo Direct (a monthly subscription of coffee
automatically shipped to your home) membership with them for three years. Last
year, when I was evaluating alternatives to Tassimo, I put my Direct
membership on a shipment hold for 6 months. Unfortunately, that 6 months was
up recently. How did I know that? I was greeted by a lovely email yesterday
saying I had a shipment of coffee on its way. I looked at the UPS tracking
number and the shipment had actually gone out two days prior. Immediately
irked that I did not receive any kind of email as a heads up that the shipment
was going to occur, I picked up the phone to call their customer service.</p>

<p>Once connected to a human service representative, I explained the scenario.
I&#8217;m not sure where this person was from but she was very monotone, dry, and
pseudo-sympathetic to my issue. She &#8220;apologized&#8221; (as that&#8217;s probably what her
script told her to say), and explained that I could put my shipment on hold
for another 6 months. I replied with a stern &#8220;no&#8221; and said that I wanted to
cancel the subscription entirely and that it was poor service of them to send
out a shipment after a 6 month hold without so much as a courtesy email to the
customer giving them a heads up and providing a means of canceling. She
apologized again and replied with saying that the maximum hold for shipments
is 6 months and offered to put my shipments on hold for another 6 months.</p>

<p>Obviously, she missed the point entirely because she wasn&#8217;t listening, or
wasn&#8217;t comprehending the essence of the situation. I don&#8217;t blame her, English
is likely not her native language and she&#8217;s just doing this job because it&#8217;s
an income. I of course blame Tassimo. While they had lost a customer who was
at one time loyal, they also lost someone who used to rave about their product
and what a great alternative it was to other brands such as Keurig. If they
continue to burn bridges, especially in terms of customer service, they will
not be around much longer. As it is, it already seems they are not doing well
with the rising popularity of Keurig and Nespresso systems.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I honestly don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m being unreasonable here to demand quality customer
service from those whom I pay to provide me with a service or product. In my
opinion, its a company&#8217;s responsibility to understand <em>and</em> sympathize with
the needs of their customers. I&#8217;m not asking for monetary compensation every
time they mess up, or provide a faulty product; all I ask from them is that
they manage the situation in a courteous, efficient, and delightful manner
(see the Zappos.com letter—even if you take out the $10 coupon, it is still is
a great example of what I&#8217;m asking for).</p>

<p>Oftentimes, I&#8217;ve had people say to me how passionate I am about things I own,
especially in regards to recent purchases. I am passionate and proud most of
the time about the purchases I make. I strongly feel that I choose products
that are high-quality or provide excellent utility or entertainment to me.
When I find something that fits the bill, I will verbally share and sell that
item to friends and family (on a recent occassion, I sold three Nespresso
machines because people could see it was a quality product).</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I&#8217;ve not said anything that hasn&#8217;t been said before but
it doesn&#8217;t hurt to bring it up again. In most cases, you do what you can to
keep the customer happy. Do that, and you&#8217;ll win customers who will desire to
work with you because they know you understand and appreciate them.</p>
